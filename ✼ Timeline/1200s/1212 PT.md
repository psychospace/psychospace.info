# Events

## Precise date unknown
The clan of goblinoids that brothers [[Arthur Graywell|Arthur]], [[Hieron Dredge|Hieron]], and [[Igor Ingolstadt|Igor]] originated from is attacked by [[Critical Hit]]. While the clan had been facing internal issues beforehand, it was this attack that forced the clan to separate and find their new paths.

Animosity grows across the [[Mer de Vide]] for the almost-half-century long [[War of the Masters]].
