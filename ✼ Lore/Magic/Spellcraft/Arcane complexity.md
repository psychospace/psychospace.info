Nearly all [[Spell|spells]] which follow the [[Magic|old definition]] have an "**arcane complexity**", codified intoÂ **levels** from zero (known as [[Cantrip|cantrips]]) to ten. This is determined by both the magnitude and difficulty of achieving the goals of the spell, in order to communicate the level of mastery over psychospace necessary to wield them. 

If one attempts to cast a spell of a complexity they are not prepared to, effects can range from nothing being accomplished to the user being incinerated, a form of minor [[altercation]].

At the far end of the spectrum, *[[Wish]]* is described as the most powerful magic available to a mortal. Wish, and 9th- or 10th-level spells in general, cause traceable cosmological changes which usually mark epochal shifts in reality; in other words, the effects of older wishes create archaeological clues, not unlike a fault in a piece of rock.

Certain spells acknowledge the differing levels of power that magic can achieve. For example, a *[[Counterspell]]* or *[[dispel magic]]* interrupts the flow of arcane energy and disrupts a spell, but only spells without protections against them will be guaranteed to be stopped.
