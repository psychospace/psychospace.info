At the base of the [[Lower Phalanx]] is **Fort Tetsudo**, an extant complex of two connected black-stone towers, mostly an afterthought of [[Gateway]]'s main battle plans. As a general rule, the city's gate only opens when the identity of each who desire to open it have been confirmed or vetted.

As is tradition, a fully armored knight, known as the ***Eidolon Knight***, always rides down the steps of the fort and stands at the gate, proclaiming, "This town shall not open to you, until all who stand before me name thyselves and enter under that pretension." Historically, this position would be filled by the [[Eidolon]] of Gateway, but [[Klemma]] has more important things to do nowadays, as well as the fact that his predecessor, Porvis, was slain in the process of this job.
