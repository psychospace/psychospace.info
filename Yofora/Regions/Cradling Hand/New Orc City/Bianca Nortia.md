The mother of [[Serena Nortia|Serena]], [[Iosif Nortia|Iosif]], [[Leonid Nortia|Leonid]], and [[Lidiya Nortia|Lidiya]], she was known for her magical prowess, leading her country through the dangers of the late [[War of the Masters]].

As with all of her line, she possessed the ability of [[monism]]. She was well-loved by her people.

Bianca was born in [[Samíx]]. The area's energy is attributed to her immense power over [[The Sheer|The Sheer]]. Through her assistance, magicians were able to find how to wield a limited form of it, through [[Runic engine|runic engines]].

When she was around 94, her soul suddenly became unreachable for reasons unknown, inciting [[Illarion Parasom]] to take over.
