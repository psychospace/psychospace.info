The **viewpoint property** of [[Magic#cast|cast magic]] is a principle of nature. It is a necessary compromise of [[Compilation]]. 
# Tenets
When you interpret the [[Divine Equation|Equation]] to create an arcane spell, or interpret a natural law to create a divine spell, you act from your **perspective** within said Equation. 

Depending on the caster, in other words, the same spell might take slightly different forms based on the “starting point” of that interpretation.

## Commonalities
Just as souls can be connected [[Soul bond|through blood or shared origin]], so too can magical starting points. As observed by magical students, collaborating on creating spells can result in “origin points” aligning more and more with one another over time, and studying from a specific professor of magic can pull a student towards that common origin. Thus, it is possible to deduce if casters have a common teacher.  ^6ab8a5

## Detriments

Due to many significant magical and cosmological events, many antiquated spells or pieces of technology operating on stative “viewpoints” no longer function, or can even be made to function from notes of their time. In other words, [[time|times]] change, and can disrupt existing knowledge on that alone.

For example, an [[Airship]]'s [[Core engine|core engine]] relies upon a common understanding of what a “[[Soul]]” does, and if such a definition has changed since (say, through evolution), cores from that era will no longer function. Such technology must be reinvented, as is the case with things like [[Void Breaker|void breakers]].
