**Aingeru Ariessus** is an elvish entertainer, who is best known for portraying the [[Witch-King]] at the [[Rainy Loch Theater]]. He is also known for being one of the many revived by [[The Pitcher]].

# History
Born in [[Arnecca]] in the 1130s in early spring, Aingeru was born with an affinity for the stars for reasons beyond their understanding. This affectation gave them a striking appearance with glimmering eyes, which was further fueled by their wood-elvish blood, making them seem even more [[Fey]] than the average elf. 

Their childhood years were mostly spent reading. A fan of stories and theatrics, and inspired by tales of [[Wildwalker|wildwalkers]], they eventually joined the cast of the Rainy Loch Theater. They acted in the role of a more child-friendly, fictionalized version of the villainous Witch-King of Qaulhain, a famous crime lord of Ain's day.

For many decades, the weekly shows at the dinner theater provided steady income. The role steadily evolved in scope and complexity, as did the fictionalized accounts of the Witch-King's many antics and the heroes who (in real life, mostly unsuccessfully) rose against him. Many of the elven children who grew up with the theater enjoyed and even idolized Aingeru for playing a "cool" villain. Despite playing a villain, while out-of-character Aingeru was impeccably compassionate, using his magic to assist where it was needed.

## Accident
In early [[1249 PT]], mid-performance, Ain fell from horseback, an unfortunate accident likely partly having to do with Ain's cosmically-light body. At first he had knocked himself out, but he was choked by a special effect of the Witch-King's trademark "[[sparking smoke]]", unexpectedly killing him. 

Due to the suddenness of the event, it was believed to be part of the act — the person playing the hero only realizing what happened when his eyes' light had faded — and Ain was unable to be revived. An elven funeral was later held, and the theater, which had been struggling for some time under its own ambition (and debts), closed for a short time in respect as Ain's understudy (who was not as good) took over the role. 

## Revival by the figure
On the Ides of Vire, several weeks after his [[Death]], Aingeru was resurrected by a pallid figure in the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]]. He awakened in a cave on the side of [[Mount Sokron]] with all the clothes he'd been buried in. He returned to the Theater unannounced, giving the others there quite a scare. When the others explained what had happened, he apologized profusely, hating to traumatize or truly horrify the children in the theater.

Through a friend in the following months, he heard of the [[Daily Grind]]'s bounty to investigate the pallid figure, and embarked to [[Ziegfeld Station]]. He pursued the bounty to free the theater of its debts and hopefully return to his old, comfortable life as an entertainer.
