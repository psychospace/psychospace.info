An **off-wave** is a type of [wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave) which exists as a flow of energy or purity in [[Psychospace]]. 

It is identifiable by devices which can pick up changes in the properties of [[Vibe]], such as [[Lux]] converters. A pattern observed in the creation and termination of off-waves is known as a [[Psinomenon]]. Spontaneous off-waves may be the product of the death of certain [[Figment|figments]], such as [[Eidolon|eidolons]].

Many creatures possess [[Magic#Latent|latent magic]] which creates off-waves, such as [[Angel|angels]].
