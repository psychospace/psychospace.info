**Enchantment** is the [[Magic]] study of **enchanters** or **enchantresses**, and is one of the eight [[Classical Schools]] of magic, interlinked with [[Evocation|Evocation]]. Enchantment is the study of affecting the minds of others through influencing [[psychospace|psychospace]], especially with the [[Golden Voice]]'s control. 

Unlike [[illusion|illusion]], the study of enchantment is persuasive in nature, not deceptive, manipulating perception, outlook, and desire. A [[True name (concept)|true name]] may be invoked through enchantment to trance a creature. 

The study further extends to the creation of magic items, also known as enchantment, but more broadly categorized as [[infusion]].

It is sometimes described as the "darkest" magic, as its direct interfacing with short-term desires holds the most potential for abuse, and much of the study of enchantment has been made black or gray through gradual legal discourse throughout the [[Mer de Vide]]. Infusion as a sub-discipline remains of interest, but has been made largely the work of systemic agencies such as [[NIMROD]] or the [[Tower of Electron]] to protect knowledge about the discipline.
