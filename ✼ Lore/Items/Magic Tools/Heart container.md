A **heart container** withholds a [[Soul]] within a [[soulstone|soulstone]], maintaining it and allowing it to be physically meddled with. It was originally made by [[Dawndust]] clerics as part of an effort to duplicate souls. Containment of a soul allows it to heal itself to its original form, using magic intended to do so. A fragment of this container acts as the material component necessary for forming a clone, [[Visitant]], or homunculus of a person whose soul is found in the container.

If completely destroyed, it can't be used again, and all fragments of the device cease to function.

Souls contained in prisons, souls hidden from the world, or bodies whose souls are disconnected, such as by astral projection, imprisonment, forcecage, magic circle, or sequester, can't be trapped in this manner even if they are willing, due to higher-degree effects placed on them. If a target is possessed by another soul, the container traps the possessive soul, and isn't killed by the process, merely returning original control. An [[Undead]] soul or fragmented soul cannot be placed in a container.

The soul within it does think, although to say it was entirely cognizant would be an outright lie, more as if it were placed in stasis, reliving its memories or dreams eternally (as if it were watching a 24/7 broadcast of its own mental imagery), until it is released. When it communicates, its personality seems more confused, sleepy, or dreamlike than afraid or angry, unable to learn any new information.

>>[!info]- D&D 5e
>>*Wondrous item, very rare*
>>
>>Through a careful [[Ritual]] costing ~1500 [[Gold piece|gp]], a sorcerer, bard, cleric, or wizard of 15th-level or higher can excise a soul from a corpse or body and place it in the heart container. The vessel must be active (that is, alive) throughout the process, and the vessel acts as if destroyed or killed when this process is completed.
>>
>>This vessel can also be a soul cage, magic jar, or simulacrum: anything with a whole soul occupying it. Inactive clones cannot be used: a clone which is resurrected from acts as a normal creature.
>>
>>When the heart container has a soul within it, that soul retains all the properties as if it were alive, except that it is considered **unconscious** while its soul remains there, and doesn't age, need food, attune to items, or have racial traits.
>>
>>The heart container has 40 hit points when it contains a soul and 10 hit points otherwise. It can restore hit points only by magical means, and can't gain temporary hit points. It spins in place lightly when it has a soul, and hovers 5 feet above the ground at all times.
>>
>>The container has the same ability scores as the soul, but can't speak if it knows a language. It can communicate only through changing its own color (which it has difficulty doing) or through telepathy to those it has unbroken line of sight to within 40 feet of it. 
>>
>>A soul can be released from the container if it is dispelled at 6th-level, or if it is destroyed by being reduced to 0 hit points. A released soul can return if its body is within 40 feet of the container, and its body isn't destroyed beyond repair. Alternatively, if the creature who facilitated the transfer passes away, the soul they bound to the container is released with them.
>>
>>To detect magic, this item gives off *necromancy* magic.
