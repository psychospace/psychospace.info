The **Giant Forest**, as the name suggests, is an extremely large forest of [[giant]] things. Nearly everything there is wild in some way. Heavily influenced by [[The Beastlands]], it is protected by the [[Father Sakura]]. It takes up quite a lot of [[Low Sacred]].

The city of [[Cherryheart]] sits at roughly the center of it.
