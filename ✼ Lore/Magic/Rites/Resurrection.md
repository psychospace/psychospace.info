**Resurrection** is a study of [[magic]] which involves the negation or reversal of [[death]]. This restores one's [[epitome]], lengthening it.

It involves immense channeling of [[Vitality energy|positive energy]], as well as hefty [[Tribute]], in order to allow a [[soul]] (usually still undergoing an escort by a [[psychopomp]]) to return to its body. This is believed to partly be defiant of [[logic]], which dictates that the process of [[reincarnation]] is more natural.

# Existence
The existence of resurrection is believed to be explained by a myth: when living things were being restored to the world by the existence of the domains of [[Athemat]] and [[Cientia]], many prayers from the time of the [[War of Chaos]] were reinstated as [[Echo|echoes]]. 

These prayers called for safety amid the world's unfairnesses, [[wish|wishes]] left unfulfilled by the consumption of the universe and the vacancy of the [[Unknown Era]] which followed. These echoes ingrained themselves in the fabric of the universe, and so, a hope for "redemption" became a complex piece of the magic that followed.
