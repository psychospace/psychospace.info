The **Flock of None** are a clan of [[kenku]], those who are from the service of Mother Miraculous and [[Mother Material]] alike, live in [[The Whiskerwood]]. Their temple is called the "Temple of None".

Their master's name is Master [[Shudder]], who is the eldest amongst their number. They each tend to the roots of the [[Heart of the Woods]] and ruminate on how it freezes the surrounding area in safe time, harboring the creativity of a thousand souls while still being out of reach willingly. Within the innermost areas of their nest lies the [[Father Sakura]]'s opposite half, the [[Tree of Time]].
