This item appears to be a normal pocketwatch, but the time on it is always right. 

However, if the owner is in immediate or impending danger (even if the owner is unaware), it will suddenly stop working and stop ticking until the danger vanishes or ends. Despite this seemingly causing the time on the watch to lag behind, it always seems to be at the correct time after its owner takes a rest or doesn't observe it for several hours.

This danger sensing ability of the watch even functions if the watch is away from its owner. Ownership of it, and thus whose danger it warns of, can be transferred by selling or trading for the watch (but not through gifting).

Instead of displaying numbers on this 24-hour watch, it shows daylight hours and night hours as a gradient. Depending on the region and time of year, the gradient adjusts to hit sunset and sunrise correctly on that specific day. In other words, it's a solar clock.

This watch is affected by any time dilation effects, but as long as the watch remains unbroken, it will always keep time. If time stops, this watch still ticks while the rest of the world is frozen.



To detect magic, this item gives off *enchantment* magic.
