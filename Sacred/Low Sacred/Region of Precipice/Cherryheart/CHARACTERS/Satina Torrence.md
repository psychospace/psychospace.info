**Satina Torrence** is a [[Tiefling]] druid of the [[Giant Forest]]. Satina is servant to the [[Father Sakura]], which her village, [[Cherryheart]], sits under the protection of. A tiefling raised by giants is not unheard of, but it is usually a giant with fiend blood that is born into the community, rather than a tiefling which flees its previous life into giants.

Though there are many people who embrace the dangers and benefits of spreading fiendish blood, they are often still split down the middle of cold and conniving fiends sourced from the Abyss's layers, or hot and warlike fiends sourced from the Hells. Satina's parents were of both worlds, and this is marked in their two toned skin.

Satina is party to the mediating faction of Cherryheart, who is attempting to prevent both giants from stomping each other out.
