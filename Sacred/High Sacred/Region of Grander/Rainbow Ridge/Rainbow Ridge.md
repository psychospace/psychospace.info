**Rainbow Ridge** is a notable town in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. A small-sized frontier village in the hills, the topography of this region and its proximity to the dangerous [[Glass Mountains]] mean Rainbow Ridge is forced to keep its small-town feel.

Rainbow Ridge was originally founded to research and defend from [[Low Sacred]].

Around 140 families live in Rainbow Ridge. Their mayor (as of [[1250 PT]]) was [[Siegfried Vangher]]. Its [[eidolon|eidolon]] is [[Abyz]].
