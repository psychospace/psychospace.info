At the beginning of the [[Linnaeus Dino|Prince]]'s journey to [[Rainbow Ridge]] in [[1250 PT]], Lylian's father and [[Tyranno Re Ursus|the king]] both urged him to take (in addition to the rest of his convoy) a squad of sixteen soldiers from [[House Burgitsk]], in order to defend from the dangers of wildlife and the potentiality of that [[Ghost storm|purple storm]]. Lylian agreed (or was somewhat forced) to attend to Linnie as well.

During the trip, twelve of these soldiers were spirited away by the storm, and their wherabouts are unknown. The remaining four are staying in Rainbow Ridge.
