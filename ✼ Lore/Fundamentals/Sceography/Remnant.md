A **remnant** is a floating landmass within the layers of [[the Planet]], suspended by [[Kibangan]]: a piece of land in a [[skysea]]. Most remnants are controlled by mortals, and many furnish their own societies and people. 

It is said that the remnants came to float in the sky as a result of some [[Old world|ancient apocalypse]]. The term "remnant" is predominantly generic, with the term **Hell** being reserved for a remnant within the [[Scarlet Skies]].

In addition, remnants can slip dimensions from [[Out There]] and “arrive” on the Planet, bringing with them unique powers. It is also rumored that there are remnants on other observable objects, including planes on [[Cien]] and the [[Lex|twin]] [[Ordo|moons]] of [[The Planet]].

Through [[Phantasm|phantasms]] or through [[Magic]], one can reach the [[Flipside|other side]] of these floating pieces, traversing the planes.
