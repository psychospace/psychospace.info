***Grander General Goods and Bads*** is a general store located in [[Lond Point]].

The duo of [[Theresa Leighton|Tessa]] and [[Tilly Herringbone|Tilly]] peddle general goods and knick-knacks, mostly concerned with (at the time) a rising national interest in foreign trinkets, as well as a modest collection of folklore and potion ingredients: hence giving the store it's cheeky name.
