**Elves** are a diverse group of #sapient  peoples who are partly [[Fey]]. A group of elves is commonly known as a **party**, though this terminology has become less specific to the elves themselves over the years.

# Traits

It's said by elven folklore that all sentient people, elves included, were once derived from [[First Magicians|the same being]]. When they used their untrained magic abilities to transmute themselves on a spiritual level, there was a distinct deviation that created the elves, who have this ability inherently, existing as comfortably without the notion of form and balance as with it. In perhaps not-misleading terms, [[Magic]] itself took on its own shape. 

Deeply attuned with the base [[Elemental energy|elemental energies]] of the world, an elf often feels the affects of differences in the atmosphere more than most. A fey's aspect of magic is such that it is transported through their genetics and is afflicted by the environmental [[Logic]], similar to dragons, which is why different sorts of elves exist: different sorts of magic do as well. It is said that elves dwell on every plane, as their propensity for the arcane leads them on journeys of indulgence and creation.

# In Society
Elves and other creatures have mingled in harmony for centuries, although the elves' often-held "holier than thou" attitude, due to their lengthy age and other difficult-to-reconcile differences, means there is always something of a barrier between themselves and others. In ancient times, such as in the civilization of [[Ith'Paraan]], elves sometimes acted as slave-masters who used shorter-lived races as expendable labor. 

Modern elves recognize the connotations these biases hold, and push back against it. 

Elven societies often exist without the delineation between genders and sexes, though elves have a perceived social obligation to possess a gender / defined-sex if that is normal in the surrounding culture, something that often feels arbitrary to an elf on the outside.

Elves have developed the complex yet beautiful language of [[Mänyya]].

# Sub-types
## High elves
Commonly called **high elves**, the ***hidarin*** are elves associated with hierarchy and governance, possessing a unique charisma. They're said to be borne of [[Divination]]. High elves often have additional features to their bodies, such as extra eyes, fingers, or joints, with some even exercising hyperflexibility.

## Wood elves
Commonly called **wood elves**, the ***lodarin*** are elves who have a traditional penchant for surviving difficult odds. Their bodies are toughened and keen-sighted, traipsing close to powers of elemental chaos. They were said to be created originally by study of [[Enchantment]]. Wood elves have bodies that are equal parts good at fending off parasites and excellent places for life to be furnished, 

## Sea elves
Commonly called **sea elves**, the ***merquarin*** are elves traditionally born near a powerful source of elemental [[water]], be that a [[Weather|Weather]] pattern or watersea. Typically born with tails, and with fanciful hair, the birth of a sea elf is often seen as a blessing. Sea elves are said to be created originally by the study of [[Conjuration]].
## Drow

Also called **blue elves** or **dark elves**^[this is considered something of a misnomer, and a bit of a touchy phrase], the **darow'kai** or **drow** are born with skin better suited for low-light environments. Just as magic may exist within [[Light (property)|Light or Darkness]], so too can elves. They are said to be borne of [[illusion]].

This affinity does not prescribe much about the elf. Their skin will be tinted anywhere from a deep navy to a pleasantly clouded sky. However, they can easily sunburn, and usually go about protecting themselves.. 

## Eladrin
The **eladarin**, **prismatic elves**, or **eladrin** as they're commonly known, are elves who are not tied to a specific classical school of magic. Flickering often between emotional extremes, eladrin are colorful in temperament and s


# Half-elf
**Half-elves** are no different. As elves were one of the most ancient peoples, they are more than able to sire children of nearly any sentient ancestry. Though traditionalist elves do not often fraternize with others for the intent of finding a mate, cultural motion towards acceptance and cooperation have led half-elven peoples to becoming a much more prevalent demographic in the last millennia. 

Humans accept half-elves with some precaution, the same way a person would treat their friend with burgeoning super powers: knowing they will be outlived is not ever an easy thing to accept to any creature. Elves don't necessarily look down on half-elves, but aren't always pleased when they fail to live up to expectation, due to an often-held belief that elves were meant to be kept far from human blood, keeping magic to themselves. 

Half-elves usually inherit something of the abilities or traits, such as their intersexuality, of their elven half, although the degree to which it manifests varies from person to person.

## Half-elf sub-ancestries
Each elven subrace inherits unique traits, and a half-elf manifests some of these traits based on the origin of their elven blood.

-   High elves have third eyes or extra fingers and have enhanced “eagle vision”, some have insane flexibility
-   Wood elves have flesh that can grow grass or flowers, some grow plants by walking, some have deer tails, some have photo-reflective eyes
-   Dark elves look like the shadows stitch them up whenever something scabs over, and their eyes glow. Some have horns
-   Sea elves are really regal and have tails, and depending on their climate are more or less “fluid” (icy climate:  stronger body, weaker flexibility, reverse for warm climate)
-   Eladrin are eladrin, some have animal traits (tough nails like hooves, teeth sharper)
-   Shadarkai are colorless eladrin and give off faint mist, in this planar structure they’re also the inhabitants of the plane of water and brothers of gith
