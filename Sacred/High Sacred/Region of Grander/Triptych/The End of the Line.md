The **End of the Line** is a pub in [[Triptych]], which is known for its tendency to harbor fugitives.

It was used by [[Ikabod Caruso]] and his companions [[Locket]] and [[Pendant]] in early [[1251 PT]] in order to stay safe from both the [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] and [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]] governments during the [[Dragonic War]].
