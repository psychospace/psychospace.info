A **watch** is a unit of [[time]], eight of which make up a [[Starfall]].

There are four watches for sun-down and four watches for sun-up. The end of the second watch coincides with high-moon, and the end of the sixth watch coincides with high-star. 

At the end of the eighth watch, the star sets, and the first watch of the next starfall begins.

While this sub-division of a day is common, many cultures use *hours*, a more [[Magic|magically]]-defined constant which is defined as a third of a watch.
