Anything created by the interactions of [[psychospace]] with the world of the living is called a **figment**, though the term usually refers to [[Creature|creatures]] created by this process.

Figment creatures source their sense of self from their circumstance of creation, most of which are either natural laws or [[Magic|magic]]. Figments can be born of either [[Light (property)|Light or Darkness]].

They do not require [[Soul|souls]], though without one, something else must maintain their bodies, such as the [[Lifeblinding|mark of lifeblind]]. ^812b62

Common types:
- [[Eidolon|Eidolons]], usually draconid creatures which are formed of and reflect the nature of a large community.
- [[Origo|Origos]], a class of being which can only manifest with an anchor known as a [[summoner|summoner]].
- [[Elemental creatures|Elementals]], created of specific axes of [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]].
- [[Quasidragon|Quasidragons]], originally made with [[Dragon|dragon]] souls and can become [[Core engine|cores]].
- [[Gremishka]], byproducts of poorly-constructed magic.
- [[Visitant|Visitants]], creatures that complete fragmentary souls or reanimate from echoes.
