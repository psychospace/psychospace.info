**Corus Ragdana**, [[Tiefling#^95da09|virtue name]] **Magnet**, was a [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacreder]] [[tiefling|tief]]-[[human]], who briefly crossed paths with the [[S4]] in the course of their [[MMT - Arc 1, Nova|early journey with the prince]]. 

After the [[Dragonic War]] and the failure of the Heartknock's [[Shiny Mask|mask]]-based [[Soul bond|bonds]], Magnet later assisted the [[Order of Hope]] in the rehabilitation of former Heartknock associates.

# History
Corus Ragdana was born in late [[1231 PT]] to two human parents in [[Wisfer]]. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to nearby [[Gateway]] for better opportunities, particularly seeking employment in the clean-up effort for the at-the-time neglected and overgrown Royal Hunting Grounds. Magnet took his virtue name for an unnatural charisma he exhibited; he had planned to be a bard when he was younger, but ended up a low-ranking [[Victory Starscouts|starscout]] for his strength. 

When he was 19 (in [[1250 PT]]), upset with his job and feeling as if the Starscouts were dulling his wit and harming his emotional state, he was eventually abducted by [[Amanita Parasom|Kingdle Fire]] off the streets. Public records made by the V's report that he vanished within a cave on a routine patrol of the [[Lilliputian Battlefield]].

By his account, Kingdle Fire, or an associate of theirs, kidnapped him and instructed him on the goals of the Heartknock, robbing him of his self-determinism and preying on his desire for a change in his life. He was forced to conduct experiments in the typical fashion the Heartknock was known for, which resulted in his and other associates attack on the [[Bazaar of Fools]] in [[Midzone]]. 

During the ensuing combat, he failed to self-destruct and was fatally shot through with an eldritch blast by [[Alexios Hawthorne]]. Because this was one of the first cult members the party had been able to "save" (without turning into [[living spell|living spells]]), the Royal Escort Group ensured that his body was quickly commuted to [[Destiny Cathedral]] and that the boy was [[Resurrection|resurrected]].

There, in thanks, he provided the party with intelligence regarding the cult.
