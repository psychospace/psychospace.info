**ELIZ** are masked children[^1] who are the long-standing custodians of [[Volk Vendleberg]]. They are members of a mysterious unit of spies ([[Trickster's Children]]) for the [[Kingdom of Sacred]].

As a child, Elizabeth was convicted for the crime of killing her own brother. She was sworn in to servitude to the King within the corps of the Trickster's Children, hopefully to make something of herself.  

In time, Eliz perfected her control over her Invoked Duplicity, becoming able to compartmentalize part of herself in what is considered, to most trickster clerics, to be a willpower-less body double. This made her --- now them, as Eliz and Zile --- accomplished members of the Trickster's Children, and a shoo-in for the role of assistants in facilitating the return of the prince.

They were instructed to both guide the adventurers and investigate the prince's whereabouts on their own.

Eliz's normal mask is that of a white and black rabbit, divided in half by a zig zag line. When Zile is around, Eliz's mask is pure white, and Zile's mask is pure black (see right).

[^1]: Trickster's Children generally pluralize when referred to.
