**Shohei Sawa Integra**, known professionally as **Sho**, is a human fighter, a charlatan, and a member of [[The Fold]] in [[Drastic]]. He was an original member of the [[S4]], under the aegis of [[Serena Nortia]].

# History
He was born in [[1227 PT]] to [[Maccus Integra|Maccus]] and [[Kazumi Integra]], along with his twin sister [[Gilda Integra|Gilda]]. His childhood at the [[Integra residence]] was mostly uneventful, being brought up in the school system of Drastic.

At 18, he joined the [[City & Castle]]. During his three years in the guard, he learned about the Fold, eventually joining them, unwittingly driving away [[Tornotto]], his partner at the time. Due to a fear of loss, Shohei began a fruitful friendship with [[Summer Sundress]], the Fold's operator, in order to avoid falling back into poverty.

On [[1250 PT#11-12-1250|11-12-1250]], he undertook a job with the Fold to induct [[Theresa Leighton|Tessa Leighton]], undergoing a basic introductory mission. However, the [[ghost storm]] [[1250 PT#11-18-1250|ensnared him]] and his soul was damaged in the process, later suddenly [[1250 PT#12-2-1250|reappearing]] in [[Rainbow Ridge]]. [[Serena Nortia|Serena]], who was nearby at the time, believed his arrival was [[◍ Apocryphal Passage - Azure Sky|foretold]] in the [[Apocrypha of Winds|Apocrypha of Winds]], and used [[monism]] on the boy, who had [[Yofora|Yoforan]] blood, to act as his "guardian angel".

With Serena as his guide, Shohei joined up with [[Lazuli Dino|Linnaeus]]' royal escort group, possibly because at the time he was in somewhat of a denial of his homosexuality.

At the time of [[Red Spark]], Shohei's still-fragile [[Soul]] was almost broken altogether by the [[Off-wave|shock]] of the death of [[Ildy]], forcing Serena to fully possess him. 

# Name
"Shohei" in [[Draconic]] means "peace in flight" (翔平). It's a phrase known for being one of the magical "phrasings" of the spell *feather fall*, as well as a common saying between Nortian pilots for safe travels.
