A **Harmon** (*HAR-moan*, pl. **Harmoni**), sometimes called an **axiomite**, is a [[monitor]] born from [[First City|Harmonia]], though more broadly serving [[the Fortress]] as a whole. 

Harmoni are the divinely-architected [[immortal]] form of pure math and [[logic]], which appears to [[Bias coagulation|mortal perception]] as flows of information that form parts of their bodies.

Each Harmon is made up of tracts of the [[Divine Equation]] (what mortals call [[psychic code]]), and act as Harmonia's architects, repairers, craftspeople, and populace. They are believed to have directly constructed the [[Lynchpin device|lynchpins]], and construct similar beings known as [[engram]].

As a Harmon changes, so too does the endless engine of reality evolve.
