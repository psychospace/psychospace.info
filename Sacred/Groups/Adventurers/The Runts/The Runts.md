The **Runts** are an adventuring party formed around the end of [[1250 PT]]. Aboard the [[Pinwheel]] airship *[[The Mimi]]*, captain [[Hikawera]] and first mate [[Medu]] sail across the skies in search of [[Gold piece|gold]] and renown.


# History
When Prince [[Lazuli Dino|Linnaeus]] initially [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour|called for an escort group]] to allow him to return to Drastic safely, it was done so as an audition process. However, the just-formed [[S4]] sidestepped that altogether in their bravery of stopping [[Phys]] from attacking [[Rainbow Ridge]], impressing the prince outright. Meanwhile, several other parties sought to claim the rewards of aiding the prince, including Hikawera, a nonbinary triton oddball [[Witchcraft|warlock]] from the remnant of Pinwheel, and Medu, a human cleric with an esoteric streak from [[Miraclesfield]]. 

Aboard their airship, along with a displacer beast kit trained by Medu named [[Ann]], the two were held up from the auditioning process by a vision Hika had received from their mysterious patron in the town of [[Ladybug]], preventing them from claiming the title of prince's ally: however, when fate brought them together, they quickly developed a rivalrous attitude with the actual escort group, becoming the adventuring party known as the Runts. 

## [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]]
For most of [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour#Arc 1]], the Runts were traveling ahead of the party, meeting up with them all several times though never seeming to find the time to really sit down and chat, what with their important missions.

Later on, a displaced [[Trobairitz]] joined the Runts, wanting to help the escort group who shared their dubious animosity towards [[Ikabod Caruso]], but steering far clear of the prince for personal reasons (later revealed to be a lingering guilt, partly magic-based, from the [[visitant|visitants]]). 

Amidst the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]], [[Certain (evangel)|Certain]], a "reincarnated" ancient angelic visitant, was liberated from the master's care by Trobi. Certain, too, joined the Runts, offering her apparently nearly-indestructible body to assist them in thanks for her rescue.

During the events of a high-society party in [[Waxtown]] during [[MMT Session 21]], the S4 had put the Runts, also secretly in attendance, to work in locking down Ikabod (whom had fled during the Siege). Within the four-stage city of [[Triptych]] is where they spent most of their time since, until Ikabod was eventually retrieved. There, [[Lucent]] drew their attention.
