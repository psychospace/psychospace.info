"**Monism**", also called "revelation", is the bloodline [[magic]] ability carried by the [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] [[Nortian imperial family|imperial family]]. Someone capable of monism is known as a **monist**. This ability manifests as a particularly extreme form of [[telepathy]].

# Ability
It is not well-defined, but it largely consists of assisting in the recovery and spiritual health of citizenry. 

Through remote vision within an unknown radius (once believed to be around 10 miles), a Nortian royal acts as a passenger for a citizen of Nortian blood, and establishes a dream and soul connection with them, not dissimilar to [[Uforia]]'s abilities. Because this generates a connection, the person who acts as "driver" knows that someone is watching them, or can easily reject it if their will is powerful enough.

During the time they are connected, the body of the royal becomes a vacant doll, with fragments of [[Soul bond|both souls]] intersecting, effecting similar visual tenuity and memory-sharing as [[visitant|visitants]]. Thus, there are both inherent dangers and benefits to revelation.

This soul connection allows the user to heal and possess bodies whose connections to their soul has been challenged (not necessarily traditionally deceased). 

# History
In ancient times, watching over the populace was deigned as holy, and so this ability was manifested by the caretakers of Uforia.
