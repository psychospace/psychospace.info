The **wildwalker** is a traditional mercenary archetype, originating in [[Bullion]] but spread out to the world at large. Also known as the *gaucho/a*, *huaso/a*, or "cowboy/girl", wildwalkers are associated with both heroes and villains, but are most well known for their skill with a horse, a bow, and a blade, as well as a remarkable panache and an unassailable style. 

The tradition emerged out of those who worked on farms in the [[Aed & Maed]], hence the name "cowboy", and developed a legendary status over several centuries, especially gaining notoriety from the reputation of the [[Blue Cinder Militia]]. The wildwalker is traditionally seen as an anti-hero. This can be traced to remnantal heroes like [[Camillo Ponderosa]] and [[Shaelyn Ealdwine]] who both fought with and against the policing of their day, battling injustice even as they came to define "justice" in [[The Shibboleth|the shib]]. The trope also has a lot of influence from a Qauli emira who helped gather the countryside's support.
