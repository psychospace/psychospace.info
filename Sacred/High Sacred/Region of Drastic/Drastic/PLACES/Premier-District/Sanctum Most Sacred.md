The **Sanctum Most Sacred**, often simply called "the Sanctum", is a temple to all gods which was built as a chapel at the foot of [[Saurus Castle]]. It is public, except for occasions decreed by members of the [[House Dino|royal family]]. Gods that are officially recognized by the country as beneficial are given shrines here, but the priests do encourage those of all faiths to arrive here and pray, so that Sacred may enjoy the benefits of all divinity and all peoples. This belief is called "[[Apeirism]]".

Behind its final door, which can be opened only by those with a royal crest, lies the resting place of all royals of Sacred in a place known as the **Garden of Kyoryu**. This place holds great power and importance, and thus many royal items, such as the [[Wings of the End]], [[The Chronicle]], and [[Dinofang]], are tied to it.
