**Velocis Raptra Invict Dino** is the [[Aasimar]] queen of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], by blood, who was queen during the [[Dragonic War]].

Daughter of [[Hadro Dino]] and [[Uta Raptra]], she married [[Tyranno Re Ursus]] in [[1220 PT]], making him king consort. As of the current year, she is around 64, but remains in peak condition thanks to her [[Celestial]] blood. She inherited the throne from her father after he passed peacefully in [[1217 PT]].

Had it not been for Queen Velocis, the remnant would not have entered its age of prosperity after the rise of [[Critical Hit]]. Thanks to their acclimation of power, they operated as trusted military and explored their newfound political power, advancing Sacredâ€™s understanding of many things.

Her son is [[Lazuli Dino]], heir to the throne. She was once inheritor to [[Dinofang]], and as such her voice is of the many heard within.
