**Copperbeasts**, also known as **clockwork beasts**, are the modern name for [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] constructs not unlike mechanical dinosaurs. In their time, they were referred to as Ith'Salo, Denizens of the Storm, assumedly because they were originally powered with storm [[Magic]]. 

They were partly crafted out of ingenuity sourced from wyvern-holds in [[The Above]]. Some copperbeasts have been revived, while others are repurposed.
