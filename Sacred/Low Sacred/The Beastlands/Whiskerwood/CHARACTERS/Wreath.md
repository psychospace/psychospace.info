**Wreath** is a child of the [[Giant Forest]] who once made pilgrimage to the [[Jungle of Foon]] in [[the Beastlands]], before settling down amongst [[The Whiskerwood]] for many a year. In this time, she became friends with that community, as she was respected as a native of the lands.

She currently spends her days half defending the entrance to the Whiskerwood and half tending to its people and hunting with them. She hopes to one day grow more allies who also love and care for the people there.

Wreath is a dryad who uprooted herself early, leaving her with a short stature. Her sparking yellow eyes inspire fear and fierceness, but also caring. She doesn't like waiting when she's been asked to do something, but is otherwise a fairly dependable and patient person.
