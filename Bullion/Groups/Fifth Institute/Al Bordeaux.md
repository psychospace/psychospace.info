Special Adjuncts **Alvan "Al" Oiko Bordeaux** are^[Referred to plurally as their desire typically shapes into. See [[#Codec Avitarita]].]  a [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Freyite]] [[Changeling#Axial changeling|mayling]] currently serving as a [[High Manteian]]. A model [[chirologist]] with the [[Fifth Institute]], and an extremely well-traveled spellblade, Al's desired names (sometimes **Albert**, other times **Alisia**) vary based on their presentation.

Today, Bordeaux are considered the most sadistic and perhaps strange of the Manteians, known for getting students into line and dealing with unusually [[Summoning|summoned]] monsters created by magical mishaps — some say they even slew a [[Dragon#Chromatic|chromatic dragon]] “solo”. Just their name is enough to cause most present company to straighten up and fear any surprise inspection.


# History
Bordeaux have not shared much on themselves willingly. Their original name, Alvan, is shared with that of a [[Alvan|particular saint]] who is widely regarded as the first [[Witch of the Plains]]. 

What is understood by chirologists and has spread throughout rumor mills is that Bordeaux likely first manifested their ability after encountering the effects of a [[Lynchpin device|lynchpin]] whose nature locked in a 'trembling' potential-space, akin to a [[Gift (witchcraft)|Gift]], held within their changeling blood.

Bordeaux's rise throughout the Institute's bureaucracy is a story only rarely told, due to their antisocial nature. Bordeaux rose to their position as a High Manteian, under the mentorship of Dr. [[Jasper Falmouth|Falmouth]], in late [[1277 PT]]. 

# [[Codec]]: Avitarita

“Al” Bordeaux is a [[Broadcaster]] defined by a permanent tie to an alternate version of themself, a tangential-potential that hovers over them like a constant cloud, whose collective [[Codec]] is known as “Avitarita”.  The two, essentially conjoined, can swap places at will, and do most physically strenuous things, such as fighting, while half-fused.
