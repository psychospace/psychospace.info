An **ambrotype** is a general term used throughout the [[The Heavens|Heavens]] for a photograph on glass, metal, or paper. 

The term was first and is primarily used to describe photographs created by soaking a pane of glass in an alchemical solution prior to exposing it to light. The process of creation is an emerging and continually improving technology. An **ambrotypist** is a popular term for a photographer.

[[Magic|Magically]], an ambrotype leverages [[Vitality energy|positive energy]] and [[Light (property)|Light]]'s relation to the elements of [[Time|time]], to create an "[[immortal]] impression" (hence the name).

# History
Prior to the [[1st century PT]], photographic prints were created entirely by hand using oil paint and other similar elements, though some understood the. Sometime in the [[8th century PT]], though, [[Freshman charge|tephra charges]] were invented, allowing immense amounts of Light to be charged and stored for later use, especially by the nonmagically trained. With a charge, though it was dangerous to use too much at a time and temperamental to shock, many alchemists began to experiment with creating images.

Certain spells, such as [[encode thoughts]], were used to bring about the preservation or restoration of [[Echo|echoes]], and photographs were one such means that this could be accomplished.

Glassy ambrotypes, in which one side of the print is lacquered black in order to produce a clearer, positive image, were invented during the course of the [[War of the Masters]] in order to supplant the role of wartime artists. Many of the earliest ambrotypes were created to preserve the history of the [[Colossal Ocean]]'s inhabitants, both for genuine historical purposes and for moral, propogandizing purposes. Ambrotypes produced by this method led to a much larger audience for the photographic technology, and with the rise of the [[Age of Adventurers]], that interest has only grown over time.

Enchanted ambrotypes, whose images could move on their own, were created first in about [[1236 PT]], but this technology remained difficult to access, such that only the most ostentatious of nobles might have them. The chemicals used to produce standard ambrotypes, however, became more accessible. 

By [[1243 PT]], most cities of any repute had at least one ambrotypist, for research purposes if not portraiture.
