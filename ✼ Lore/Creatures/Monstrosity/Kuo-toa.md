**Kuo-toa** are piscine, [[Aberration|aberrant]] humanoid monsters of mostly middling stature, with a deceptively immaculate [[Magic|magic]] running through their veins. They are mostly found underground and in proximity to sources of water, apparently forced there by the [[Divinity|gods]].

# History

Intensely devout and created by the [[Aboleth]], kuo-toa were gifted with a god-making inspiration, and were originally born with many eyes, as were many creatures of the pre-[[The Gathering|Gathering]] era. The aboleths intended to use them to usurp the divinity in [[Ritual|rituals]] akin to the [[Mortal God Ritual]], but were stopped from this calling by the god [[Bioh]], who supposedly [[Calamity of the Eyes|thieved most of their insight]] and began to force them into their present, fishlike state.

This forcing-underground eventually put the kuo-toa into contact with the [[Illithid|illithids]], who would become their more famous masters. Similarly forced underground, the mind flayers forced the kuo-toa into inhospitable psionic conditions to take what was left of their minds for themselves. The result, hundreds of thousands of years later, is a broken-minded race who still harbor more than the potential for creating gods.

Why they resemble [[fish|fish]] is unknown, though it is possible that the aboleth which created them simply determined this shape as appropriate for their similarly aquatic masters.

# Abilities

A kuo-toa, mad its in own madness, has such an influence on [[psychospace]] without even realizing it, that a determined kuo-toa can bring its most devout thoughts to [[Figment|life]]. The forms these godlings take will be often random or inconceivable. When this happens, an entity it creates will often become a minor guardian spirit, or, in rare cases, arise beyond the veil of [[Welkin]], becoming a footnote in the lists of minor entities attributed by [[Witchcraft|witches]]. Kuo-toa consider their own gods to be theirs, and their gods similarly only usually desire to protect kuo-toa.

Against the effects of the Gathering, kuo-toa seem incapable of listening to mortal reason and greatly fear outsiders (as time and again they have been exploited), and thus fear of their contagion of faith extending outside their borders seems almost infantile, compared to what the gods attempted to quell with the [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpins]].
