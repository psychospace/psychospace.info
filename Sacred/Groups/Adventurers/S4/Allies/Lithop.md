**Lithop** (*lye-thopp*) is a [[Visitant]] of [[Linnaeus Dino|Linnaeus]]. 

Crafted from the prince's sense of love for nature, she was [[Ikabod Caruso]]'s second creation for the purpose of curing the [[Dragonic Curse]], deemed a failure. 

During [[Red Spark]], her unconscious body fled the [[Ivan's Tiger|Ivan's Tiger]] and traveled to [[Whitecrow]]. There, she became something of a hermit making a life for herself in the ghost town, though troubled by a lack of memories and a lack of a name. [[Serratura Neeman]] eventually arrived there as a result of the [[Ghost storm]], working together with her while waiting for the [[S4]] to track them both down.

Lithop is among the most emotionally young of the visitants, though her appearance doesn't belie her knack for survival and care for the world.
