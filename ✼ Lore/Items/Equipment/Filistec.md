A **filistec** (*fil-lih-stehk*) is a term for a [[Magic|magical]] energy weapon, usually a large, mounted gun on the deck of an [[Airship|airship]]. Filistecs first widely saw use during the last war of the [[Carapa Republic]].

The name filistec means 'banner' in [[Old Duer]]. 

Powered by a variety of sources, filistec batteries are intended to assail and disable the [[Core engine|cores]] of other vessels, effectively destabilizing and cutting their lift. The downside is that a magically-powerful caster must be the one to man the battery, similar to a [[Witness|Sarcoph]].
