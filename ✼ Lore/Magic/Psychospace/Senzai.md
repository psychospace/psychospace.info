All [[Soul|souls]] have a level of psionic perception known as **Senzai**, an ancient word in [[Draconic]] which means “quotient” or “invisible sight”. This allows a character to see things just on the other side of the real. This acts as a form of passive arcane understanding that grants sight into [[psychospace]], due to ones knowledge of how it operates.

A powerful senzai can be naturally inherited, or trained with years of study and practice. The most powerful senzai can only be achieved by those with uniquely tuned psychic forms, or those with incredible magic prowess.

Even with a powerful senzai, the form of [[Kibangan]] is somewhat imperceptible from a person's perspective on the [[Wild Blue Yonder]].

Ancient creatures had particularly high *senzai* for a currently unknown reason, likely their coming into existence alongside psychospace itself. For example, the [[Scribe moth]] was known for having one of the highest senzai ever recorded, which granted it the ability to etch ancient runes and create rudimentary portals.
