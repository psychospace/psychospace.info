Long ago, a stone wall surrounded [[Drastic]], built long before airships existed to trivialize them. This wall has fallen to deterioration over time, and sometimes the towers, quarters, and forts built within the wall have been repurposed. Such is the case with this place, the **Oldwall Pub**, one of [[Critical Hit]]'s early acquisitions in the time of their adventuring.
