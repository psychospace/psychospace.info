>This narration was written for the final moments of [[Zero Day]], when the [[tailed stranger]] appeared, froze time, and spoke to the S4.

>“This is it. This is really it. Everything they've been saying for weeks and weeks and weeks. The entire world holding its breath. Point of no return. Terror beyond imagination. Problem to be solved. Our enemy."
 
*[It reaches its hand behind its back and retrieves, a **gun**. A revolving [[firearm]] of [[RDM-8|unknown design]]. Eight bronzed chambers, glimmering with silver rounds.]*
 
 *[It points the gun at each of your frozen selves in turn. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK.]*
 
 *[It... **never** fires. Not even once.]*
 
 *[It laughs faintly, impressed by the absurdity. It seems to be losing its cool, frustrated beyond words. And in one swift motion, its arm [lashes out behind it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloping) with the weapon. Eyes shut. Breath held. CLICK. **BANG**.] *

*[Shrapnel flies from the roof of the Nail of Nortia. A bullet buried into brick... And now, the revolving chamber springs open, and the gun is empty. it breathes in, an imperceptible moment of panic and pain and fear and... resoluteness. The smell of gunpowder is the only thing perceptible in the still, cold air.]*

> "Stunning.

> "That I’m here, now that I’m actually, *really* fucking here, a decade before this vessel came to be... But it's more than that. Not the potent energy in the air. That isn't getting to us. Its not the severe panic, the fear, the heartbreak all in unison.

> "It's... this view. Nobody told us it would be so beautiful. Nobody here to appreciate it ‘cept us and you.

> "Always half the picture missing," *[it says, wiping the sunglass-half of its glasses with its jacket sleeve. Tears stream down the front of its dress-like-shirt.]* "Ha.

> "The people who sent me here, sent me to avert today. To gather information on today. To kill you. Save the world, they tell me. Over and over. Solve the problem. Sounds familiar, hm? And if I just do what they ask. I could make all of my awful fucking life... worth it.
> 
> "But despite it all, I cannot erase you. You're part of us. You’re why…. we **are**. We’re proof that you succeeded. You can't unmake what makes you.  
> 
> "Who am I to you? I'm not just one thing. I'm an omen. Just like you," *[it says, indicating Serena.]* "And that's all we can be.
> 
> "We wish we could explain the things we’ve seen, the worlds I’ve yet to see. Around every corner, another thing unseen. There’s no taking back the pain they’ve put me through to get me here.
> 
> "But when my clock resets, all that matters is what we take home. This is our secret. A moment of peace: an eye in a storm. And I’m… glad I saw it. The end is not the end. 
> 
> "…I know what I have to do. Thank you, and… see you if we see you.”
