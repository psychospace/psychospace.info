In [[magic|arcane]] terms, a **portal** is a form of artificially-created threshold between [[Plane|planes]], or between two separate locales on the same plane. Using a portal, one can effect the ability of **teleportation**, transporting themselves without traversing any (or as much) physical space in between.  ^d4d606

Many form of portals exist, from those powered by [[Rune|runetech]] and the [[The Sheer|Sheer]], to those instantaneously created by a [[dimension door]], to those used in [[enchantment]] to maintain a [[Plane#Demiplane|demiplane]]. 

[[Phantasm|Phantasms]] are a form of naturally-forming portal which transcends traditional [[gravity]]. Natural portals also form pointed towards [[The Fortress|the Fortress]] and [[elseworld]].

# Properties
A portal consists of three things: a primary destination, an entryway, and a corridor. 

A corridor is usually a structure bound to a [[Plane#Sphere|sphere]] or higher plane, facilitating transportation and manipulation of volumes of space on a lower plane. Portals created by [[Magic#Cast|cast magic]] usually use [[psychospace]] as their corridor, though the Sheer, the [[Kibangan|firmament]], and the [[Chartless Sea]] work for this purpose as well. 

As usual with magic, [[tribute]] must also be used to ensure the structure is hospitable and accurate to the designated destination. In many cases, this tribute is assured by a piece of equipment, such as the [[Tower of Electron]] in [[Drastic]], which facilitates the [[City & Castle]]'s carved-open warp doors

## Destabilization
Portals which are not supported or find themselves poorly supported result in destabilizations, which, due to the incomplete connection between the origin plane and the corridor, can cause catastrophic results, such as [[Ghost storm|portal storms]].
