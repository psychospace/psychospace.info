A **train** is a rapid-transportation vehicle for land-use, usually powered by a [[core engine]], which is driven by tracks that guide its movement. Its massive inertial velocity allows it to carry either vast amounts of cargo or large groups of people efficiently, depending on the purpose the train is built for.

Core-engine trains produce hard-light wings, much like airships, in order to act as air-resistance powered steering, brakes, and acceleration.

Trains long predate the invention of the modern core engine and [[airship]], inspired by partly-magic ropeways and funiculars constructed by [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] skyfolk. For most of their existence, trains have been associated with mining operations and intra-[[Remnant|remnantal]] logistics, where the restrictive tracks and need for infrastructure across distance is most useful.

For larger trains, metal is the usual material they're constructed of, though sometimes creatures are harvested for flexible armor, such as in the case of [[scribe adder|adders]], which give the trains of [[Bullion]] their distinctive look.
