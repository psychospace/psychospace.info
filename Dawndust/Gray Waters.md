The **Gray Waters** are an important landmark of [[Dawndust]]. In addition to being where the first [[quasidragon]] [[Core engine|cores]] were created, the site has existed as a place of spiritual import for hundreds of years. Its [[MÃ¤nyya]] name is **Aerena** and those who grew up near it are known as *Aereni*.

The waters are a unique geographic feature which contains a miniaturized form of the cycle of [[Soul|souls]] within it, allowing them to be cultivated and, ideally, reused. It is widely believed that the Gray Waters are permanently enriched by [[vitality energy]], hence this property, similar to the 'waters' of [[Mana (plane)|Arcadia]]. The people who lived near the Waters took on some of its effects. 

# Properties
It is one of hundreds of places in Dawndust that have spiritual and religious importance, although due to the way water can seep into the earth, even those who do not directly live nearby it are born Aereni elves.

The town directly adjacent to the Waters has also been so thoroughly worshipped throughout time that it has become an [[Phantasm|oasis]] intermingling with the [[flipside]] plane of Dawndust, [[Pandemonium]]. While this may seem like a bad thing, its effects have subsided generally as the plane's nature has shifted over time. The Gray Waters' existence and nature may be linked closely with Pandemonium, but there is a general attitude of "don't explain the holy with science" throughout the remnant.
