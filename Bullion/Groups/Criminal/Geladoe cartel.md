The **Geladoe cartel** is an infamous [criminal syndicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime) and [cartel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_cartel) of [[Bullion]], involved in the illicit trafficking of chemics, weapons, magic paraphernalia, and people, as an exchange of power. Though its history stretches back a century to around [[1159 PT]], they have significantly grown in prominence since [[1270 PT]] thanks to the dangerous and terrifying abilities of its [[Broadcaster]] leadership.

According to [[Blue Cinder Militia|Blue Cinder]] intel, the cartel has its fingers in almost every criminal enterprise on the remnant. 

# Characterization
It is characterized by sheer ruthlessness, with no moral holds barred. The cartel aims to protect the networked flow of the black market in Bullion -- what they call '*the run*' -- with its members believing that they are the real authority in Bullion.

Following its rise to prominence, the leaders have oriented the cartel more towards securing permanent control, echoing in the footsteps of the [[Witch-King]] and his terrorizing of the areas surrounding [[Thunder-Fork Temple]]. 

The Geladoe cartel has given a criminal home to many [[Psion|psions]] of a rebellious age, granting them reason and goal to vent their destructive frustrations on the world around them -- to take whatever they desire, and accept no substitute. Many of the worst criminals on Bullion in recent memory, since the advent of [[new magic]], were members or friends of the cartel.

# Etymology

Contrary to popular cultural belief, the cartel is not named for a single family, instead for the portmanteau of three names, whose cooperation created the cartel network as it exists today -- the Geiger crime family who operated in the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]], the Lara crime family who operated in southern [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qaulhain]], and their unifying benefactor; the two had formed an alliance thanks to the work of a mysterious [[Witchcraft|witch]] known only as [[Doe]]. Therefore, the cartel they formed was known as the "GeLaDoe" group, with its popular stylization of *Geladoe* turning it into a proper noun.

Some of the members today, especially those recruited from outside families, consider themselves members of a greater Geladoe family, and thus the term has transcended its original intent.
