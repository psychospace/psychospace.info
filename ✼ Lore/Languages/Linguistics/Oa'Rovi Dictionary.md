# Lexicography
* Sounds have associated meanings. As such, depending on why a subject is referred to, or more generally the dialect being spoken in, a subject or verb might be represented by a number of similar phrasings.
* Root sounds joined at a letter can contract together when written (HA + AI = HAI). This is mostly a stylistic decision, and was common with names, but can imply certain consistencies.
* Paired roots form word-parts; word-parts are formed by combining root sounds
* There is not strong vocabulary for math, as those who spoke Primordial as part of their culture did not have a modern concept of certain “core” aspects of mathematics, such as zero and operations.
* Verbs are conjugated first by number and then either by an associated element or by temporality (depending on animacy of the action).
* Animacy of nouns is usually indicated by elementally-typical phrasing.
* Traditionally, syllables broken by consonants (when comprising compounds) are attached by apostrophes, however hyphens are occasionally used for modifier phrases (such as va or zu)
* Second-order compounds or higher often move the apostrophe of most specificity to the highest-order prefix. For example, the dialects of Oa'rovi are identified by \[blank]'oarovi.
* Common transliterations of runic words or phrases are written between curly brackets, i.e. {NOVA}.
* Whenever a letter does not form a compound on its own, it takes a separate form called a "explicit" form. In Common transliteration, this is indicated by a double letter, one being lowercase. 
	* For example, the "v" in "Rav" is explicit, so it is indicated as {RAVv}.
	* The exception is L, which is notated **=L** when it appears to terminate a compound and **L=** when it appears to precede a compound (but not when it appears in a phrase).

# Sentence structure
* Generally SVO, but easy to find casual or incidental exceptions such as VO or SSO.
* Adjectives, adverbs, and prepositional phrases are treated as equals: while the latter two follow patterns it generally falls on the listener to gather context about the statement
* When spoken for dramatic effect, unclear subjects are treated as inanimate references until they are more easily identified. 
* All living things, things animated by magic, and spells are treated as animate when they are referred to; 
	* In general, animacy is associated with magic
* A carried over quirk from the original Dwarven transcribers: if someone is using the “purpose” of a device, conjugate that noun as if it were a verb (English equivalents would be “leash” and “to leash” or “phone” and “to phone”).
* Questions are terminated by the nature of your inquest (in English a comparison would be saying "The place of your origin where?" to ask "Where were you born?"), as though it were an adjective
* In place of question marks, a semicolon like mark is used, followed by ending punctuation. The mark is also used akin to a semicolon and is pronounced “ñ” when it appears to conclude a statement.

Auran - **Aθ'oarovi** - A breathy, relaxed language that has been described as a slow exhaling of air.

Aquan - **Daš'oarovi** - A flowing language full of subtleties of meaning.
