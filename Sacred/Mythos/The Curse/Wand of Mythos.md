*Wand, very rare, requires attunement by a spellcaster*

This wand, topped with the Victory Star and with heart-shaped gems inset in its grip, has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 2 of its charges to cast the *polymorph* spell (save DC 13) from it, without expending a spell slot. You do not have to concentrate on this spell, but you also cannot choose the form they are polymorphed into, instead metamorphosing them into a beast or monstrosity of equal or lesser strength to their natural form. For players, this relies on their level as their CR: for DM-controlled characters, it naturally relies on their current CR. In either case, the transmutation is into a creature with a CR as close to theirs as possible, randomly chosen from the pool up to 3 CR below their own. The remainder of the restrictions on polymorph still apply.

You can also use an action to use 1 charge to gain general information and mythology on a creature whose face or eyes you can see within 100 feet of you. You can cast this on drawings of a creature to gain similar information, provided you've seen what the drawing depicts before, and you've seen their eyes or face. If a creature doesn't have a face or eyes, or you haven't seen their face or eyes, you can't use this effect on them, even as a drawing.

A creature targeted by this must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC 15) or reveal information to you mentally. (Note, this reveal has no "voice" to it, so it is incapable of revealing if it is a shapechanged creature.) They reveal their name, their game type and size, their current and max hit points, their armor class (and the causes for it), any damage resistances and immunities they have, and a short blurb about themselves and their objectives (as vague as possible). A creature in an alternate identity or form can only reveal information about that identity or form (e.g. targeting a druid currently Wild Shaped into a stegosaurus would give you information on stegosauruses). If a creature fails this save, for the next minute, if you can still see the creature or the depiction, you can use your reaction to perceive changes to the information you gleaned from this effect (e.g. changes in armor class or current hit points). If the creature passes behind a wall and breaks line of sight from you, this effect ends.

Once you use a capability of the wand on a creature, success or fail, you cannot use that ability on them again for the next 24 hours.

This wand regains 2 charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, and you have no spell slots remaining, roll 1d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into sand and is destroyed.

*[The Enemy Knows The System.]*

To detect magic, this item gives off strong *[[conjuration]]* magic.
