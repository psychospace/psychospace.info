>[!question|ttl-c bg-c-blue] Not to be confused with [[resurrection]] or [[necromancy]].

**Reincarnation** is a powerful natural process, whereby [[Soul|souls]] (usually [[Death|deceased]]) are recycled and granted new [[Creature|life]] distinct from the ended life. It is also an intrigue of [[magic]].

In the process of reincarnation, in almost all cases, knowledge of any past lives will not be accessible or relevant to the new life.

## Natural reincarnation
Reincarnation for mortal creatures occurs naturally at the very end of its soul's [[Epitome|epitome]]. 

When a [[Petitioner|petitioner]] is killed or successfully serves its sentence, the soul inside it reincarnates through the [[Vitality energy|positive energy]] and [[Echo|echoes]] contained within returning to [[Mana (plane)|Mana]] to be washed afresh. [[Exponen|Nexos]] may also rule that a soul might not have performed enough tasks to truly be judged, such as in the case of a child's death, a sentence which conveys the soul directly to [[Melotte]]'s care. The heroic dead can choose to reincarnate at any time.

Certain creatures, such as [[Dragon|dragons]], undergo reincarnation as part of their cycle of existence, and [[sorcery|sorcerers]] bonded to these types of bloodlines may inadvertently access previous life memories.[^1] Through external means, such as [[Origo|origos]] or *[[Fylgja|fylgjur]]*, a soul may follow a particular lineage, rather than proceed to an end point. Other sapient creatures are able to repurpose their souls when they die using [[Succession (ability)|Succession]]. 

## Artificial reincarnation
An artificial reincarnation can be effected through a high-level [[Transmutation|transmutation]] [[ritual]] or through ritualistically-created items, like the [[Mutagen of Absolute Self]]. Artificial reincarnation has the goal of some continuity of memory and perspective throughout the process.

[^1]: For example, [[Kessah]] was able to access [[Sekkan-shin]]'s past life as Hosuseri through her bond to [[Champo]]. In Kessah's [[Dream|dreams]], Hosuseri recalled his familial connection to [[Uforia]] and [[Arahabaki]], prior to Sekkan or Kessah learning of this.
