**Taphrine**^[taff-rinn], also known as **taphrine plague**, is a highly-infectious disease of the skin, eyes, and lungs. It gets its name from its most common symptom in the form of chemical-burn-like lesions and blisters, which leave scars resembling "graves" or "pits" in the skin. 

Taphrine is deadly to many of those who catch it. Around 1 in 6 with the disease do not survive. Treatment consists of skin-applied chemics, the prevention of further infection or inflammation, as well as bed rest. 

Similar to a [[curse]], taphrine is resistant to many [[magic]] treatments for illnesses, save for the most [[Arcane complexity|complex]].

An epidemic of taphrine spread across the [[Mer de Vide]] from around [[1275 PT]] to [[1283 PT]], affecting [[Bullion]] particularly. The Bullion strain affected 15-20% of its total citizenry, and cases still emerge on the remnant every now and then. Across the entire skysea, its spread was blamed on [[new magic]].

# Properties
Taphrine has infected many animals, though it is only symptomatic to sapient creatures. It is possible that it parasitizes the [[soul]] or [[fylgja]] of the host, which are most potent in sapient creatures. It is also believed to be spread through exposure to [[Reality-Bending|reality-bending]].

It is believed to be spread through multiple vectors, but primarily mucosal, through aerial infection, or through eating an infected animal, leading it to ravage many societies which rely on livestock. Diagnosis of the disease can only really occur once it has attacked the body, which it only does once its period of infectious maturity has concluded, around 8 [[Starfall|starfalls]] post-infection, leading to unexpected outbreaks. 

## Effects
Once it fully manifests, it usually begins by infecting the lower back and spreading out and up from there, afflicting the limbs, neck, and head. The disease is painful and gradual, potentially causing shock as the infection develops (or, as many survivors describe it, as the infection "reaches" through them). It especially attacks the lungs or eyes, and in several cases has caused punctures of the lung tissue or altered the shape of the eye in the course of its infection.

Taphrine lasts around 16 starfalls post-infection on average, before new symptoms cease and the disease fades. Someone who caught taphrine before is liable to be infected again. Its mortality rate rapidly increases for the immunocompromised or elderly.

## Prognosis
Almost everything taphrine attacks and parasitizes is harmed or changed in the process.

A survivor of taphrine is often left with lasting bodily damage, most visually in the form of scars resembling extreme burns. The extent of damage varies case-to-case, but many survivors have reported continual struggles as a result of reduced function of their skin or lungs. In about 10% of cases, the infection claimed almost all function of a digit or limb.

For reasons still not understood, some survivors (around 30%) report forming invalid or incorrect memories, experiencing hallucinations, or recalling a time they weren't alive or conscious for. These symptoms, adjacent to those of [[bias coagulation]], was what initially connected the disease to [[new magic]].
