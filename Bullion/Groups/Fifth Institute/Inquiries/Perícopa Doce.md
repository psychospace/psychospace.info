**[[Perícopa]] Doce** (P5-12) refers to the [[Fifth Institute]]'s sum-total inquiry into [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]]: their role, creation, use, and greater significance. 

Perícopa Doce, or Perícopa 12, is one of the Fifth's earliest fundamental studies about the Heavens and [[the Gathering]] especially, reiterating the [[Fourth Institute]]'s original Perícopas after its destruction. However, P5-12 was greatly expanded in importance by the studies of [[Mujtaba Shahin]], with the discovery of the [[Triplicate]] and his formalized redefinition of lynchpins, and later still with the advent of [[new magic]], whose principles relevantly clashed with those of lynchology.

Today, P5-12 remains one of the deepest inquiries conducted by the whole might of the Fifth.
