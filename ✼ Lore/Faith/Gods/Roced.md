**Roced** is the god of [[Devil|devils]], of excess and [[Necromancy]]. Also called the "Arbiter of the Afterworld" or the "Blood Arbiter", it is said that his visage is sported by the [[Psychopomp|gatekeepers]] of the [[Scarlet Skies]] and that wherever he is depicted, he will be there also. It is for this reason that he is the god least often depicted.

As the god of excess, Roced is associated with the ostentatious, with the vain. But even in this Roced is not necessarily a wholly bad god, instead offering insight on the passage of time and the advancement of progress to the point where vanity, greed, and embellishment become possible.
