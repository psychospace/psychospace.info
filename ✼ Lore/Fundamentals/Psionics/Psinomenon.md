A **psinomenon** (*sih-nomm-enn-on*, pl. **psinomena**), also called an **off-tide** or sometimes a **leyline**, is a tide-like [[Psionics|psionic]] observation in [[Off-wave|off-waves]], a pattern in how [[psychospace]] flows with more or less energy based on location, time, or presence. Psinomena are to psychospace what [[Weather]] is to [[The Heavens]].

Due to the pervasiveness of psychospace, like laws of nature, psinomena can usually be observed without the identification of its source. Psinomena usually lead to the powers observed in [[Confluence|confluences]].
