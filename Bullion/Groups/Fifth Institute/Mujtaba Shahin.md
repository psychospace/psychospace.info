Dr. **Mujtaba Shahin**^[(moodge-tah-bah shaa-heen)] was a [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qauli]] archaeologist [[dwarf]] considered incredibly important to the study of [[Lynchpin device|lynchpins]].

Prior to his time in academia, Shahin had long worked as a special advisor to the [[Golden Council]] in matters of historical preservation and investigation. 

# History
In [[1111 PT]], after uncovering an object later described as the [[Triplicate]], an object which exists "thrice", Shahin described identifying commonalities of the group of specialized artifacts now known as “[[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]]”. This was long before they became part of the public zeitgeist, and Shahin had to work hard to get his findings published. Eventually, he found an ally in the Alect Commissioner of his time, and subsequently other research fellows at the [[Fifth Institute]]. 

As his work became the fundamentals of [[Perícopa Doce]], which threatened to explain a great deal of the phenomena surrounding [[the Gathering]], he shortly thereafter was made an honorary [[Alect Keeper]]. In the earlier days of P5-12, his name was used as a covert alias by many of those researching various topics.

In modern times, following [[Zero Day]], Shahin has given his role up to his protégée [[Ema Ekotoba]]. Following the [[1284 PT|fire]] that occurred recently at the [[Sinag National Library]], he divested himself of his research to protect it.

## Current Affairs
Though retired today, the dwarven scientist continues to contribute much to the commentary in his field. He now lives with his family at a manor home in [[Mezcoatl]], rumored to be on property where yet more lynchpins have been found.
