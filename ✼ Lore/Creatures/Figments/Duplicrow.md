A humanoid lifeform created by the [[Tower of Electron]], **duplicrows** are harpy-like creatures share more in common with kenku, allowing them to be mimic actions, instead of a kenku's words. They were named "duplicrows" by Old King [[Hadro Dino|Hadro]], who oversaw their initial creation, naming them after their black-purple feathers and hair.

Born from eggs created by magic, hatching in only days, they have winged arms extending out into four fingered hands. The messiness of their creation often leaves them with several defects, unique to each (for example, missing eyes, fragile hair strands, bowed legs, missing hands, etc.)

Invented by [[Succotash]] with the help of [[Nery Ravenna]], they are generally crafted from feathers, clay, spices, sugars, and plenty of magic, in clutches of 8 or 10 eggs per batch. While initially a promising effort, the duplicrows were found to be far more useful to create batches of than to attempt to use in complex scenarios, as their dimwittedness leaves much to be desired. However, their invention led to many more discoveries in understanding crafted creatures.

Their simplicity and quantity allows them to act as couriers throughout the nation of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]].  

The creation of a duplicrow can be accomplished through casting *create homunculus*. As such, it has little in the way of capabilities beyond that which its given, which is to say it doesn't have many abilities at all.
