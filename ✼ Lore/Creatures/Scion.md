A **scion** (*sy-onn*) is any [[Creature]] whose birth arises in the event of the tangling of mortal and [[immortal]] bloodlines, usually #sapient.

Since the realms often cross with the influence of [[Kibangan]], this type of blood was not uncommon in the time following [[The Gathering]], where the gods' influence began to wane and mortals began to claim the [[Remnant|remnants]]. 

Often, a direct influence fades after a single generation, but can recur later on down the line in unexpected and surprising ways. They are incredibly common in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] and in the [[Great Nortian Empire]], due to their independent contact with immortals through their [[Flipside|flipsides]].

Examples include [[Evangel|evangels]], [[aasimar]], [[Tiefling|tieflings]], and [[ganzi|ganzis]].

# Etymology
The term "scion" is from [[Oa'Rovi]].
