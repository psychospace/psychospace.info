**The Unfortunate**, previously known as the Crew of *the Unfortunate*, previously known as the Crew of t*he Fortunate*, are a motley crew of adventurers who are following a mysterious map throughout the remnants. They were originally from [[Archipel]].

-   Captain **Verv Banner**, a [[Changeling]] who claims to be ancient royalty. 
-   Engineer **Solomon Davies**, a [[Beastkin]] artificer whom was rescued by his faith in the [[Accidental God]].
-   First Mate **Dolly**, a [[Tiefling]] berserker whose true intentions are shrouded in a supreme antisocialness.
-   Chaplain **Yoster Doswell**, a [[Human]] grave cleric who is often dour.
-   Cook **Chip Doswell**, a human [[Witchcraft|witch]] who is Yoster's much more cheery sister.

In late [[1250 PT]], these folks were in [[the Money Pit]] complaining about how Dolly lost them their last airship in a drinking game (which she insists she lost by technicality) and how their companion, the dwarf **Sir Shinyrock**, might lose his job as a jeweler too, cutting off their financials as well. They were stranded in [[Gateway]] because their airship (for whom they were names) is lost and they can't walk back to [[Ladybug]] or [[Pendulum]] to obtain passage to Archipel without protection and without running up against the storm. 

That was the case until the party offered to put them on the job of returning the [[Aerkastelo]] back to its original place in Archipel.

However, when the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]], the Aerkastelo was destroyed, and the Unfortunate were instead one of the [[S4]]'s allied groups performing necessary tasks around the capital city.
