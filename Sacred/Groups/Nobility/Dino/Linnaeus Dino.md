**Linnaeus Mi Invict Dino**, also nicknamed "**Linnie**", is the prince of the [[Kingdom of Sacred|Kingdom of Sacred]], the prodigal son of King [[Tyranno Re Ursus]] and Queen [[Velocis Dino]]. As a prince, he was the subject of concern in the [[Dragonic War]]. 

A [[Human|human]] [[aasimar|aasimar]], he fashions himself a paladin as his mother was, although he dedicates himself to the power of devotion (or love as he puts it) rather than his mother's oath to the ancients. He wielded the mighty [[Dinofang]].

# History
He was born in [[Drastic]] on the Seventeen to Kalends of Ersta, [[1229 PT]].

Secretly, he bore the [[Dragonic Curse]], which was detected prior to his birth. [[Ildy]], [[Eidolon]] of [[Drastic]], had sworn to assist him as a companion to suppress the curse from birth. 

Linnaeus was born after [[Critical Hit]] came to prominence — after the ban was repealed and when the [[Age of Adventurers]] had begun in earnest. He was, from a very early age, inquisitive and cunning, never taking unknowns to be answers. Even to recent times, he was a notorious note keeper, always being caught jotting something down or taking some plant to sketch it or press it later. He would also never be caught alone, always wanting to share journeys with others. 

While he could never rid himself of Ildy, who’d been appointed at his side to oversee him from birth, he also sought counsel and aid from his own friends, notable among their number [[Varri Raptra]], [[Aster Claudius]], and, of course, the paladin dragoon-in-training [[Lylian Burgitsk]].

However, all cures attempted seemed to fail, including an attempt where [[Werwin Krara]] was requested to the task, but was unable to, forcing his memory to be [[Modify memory|modified]]. 

In [[1250 PT]], Linnaeus eventually turned to [[Ikabod Caruso]] for aid, an act which both created the [[Visitant|visitants]] of his [[Soul]] and united the [[S4]], and eventually led to his curing.

He approached Stage 4 of the curse when Ildy was slain and his affliction was revealed audaciously [[Red Spark|during the Summit]], an event which kicked off the [[Dragonic War]]. 

He was kidnapped, spending the following months within the clutches of the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], taken to the [[Nail of Nortia]] in [[New Orc City]]. After succumbing to his curse and losing his protector, his current status was unknown for a long time, only sighted in truth just after the [[Blackflame]] was transferred to its vessel in the [[Wings of the End]].

However, during [[Zero Day]], the spirit of Arahabaki which had awakened within him was defeated, and in doing so the curse of that dragon had lifted from his body and spirit. Having been rescued, he returned to Sacred, with his newfound wings.
