Manifestation of the grudge of [[Arahabaki]] and [[Arizhmiya]], the **Dragonic Curse** was a long-standing plague on the crown of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. It was cured in [[1251 PT]] on [[Zero Day]]. ^a18b0b

# History
The hatred which [[Arizhmiya|Lagacia]] felt for [[Anti]], which had stolen its "endpoint" by making it [[immortal]], metastasized into the power of [[occultation]], the ability to "stop" the [[Time|future]]. Over time, this hatred, which caused Arizhmiya to shatter its body and forgo its former name, burrowed itself into the [[blackflame]], which it would use to [[Breaking of Sacred|break Sacred]].

This power manifested practically when [[Arahabaki|Umisachi]] and [[Uforia|Yamasachi]] were born. The hatred [[Arahabaki]] felt for the angels that confined it in [[Stygian]], keeping it from using its functional [[Immortal|immortality]] nor from allowing it to end, just as the source of its power had despised. This, too, began to manifest occultation when it became a [[curse]].

This grudge burdened the angels, and was inherited by the [[anlage]] and [[Evangel|evangels]] which came after them. By the time of the Republic, the cursed halo had been confined to the blackflame artifacts they had retrieved, and originally planned to be wholly locked away in [[Aet'Caldwyn]] along with its source in the [[Invertebra]]. 

## Use as a weapon
However, eventually, the [[Carapa Republic]] was challenged by the invaders of the [[Plesio Falknjir|Falknjir line]]. 

In the final battle of the [[Drastic|Holy Port of Ace]], the curse was invoked by [[Aso ar'Carapa]] on the rulership itself of the remnants. With the secrets of unsealing or curing this curse dying with Aso, xy certainly was hoping to ensure that the Contingency would bee the only force capable of undoing this curse, and thus only a Carapaean could do so.

The curse continued to strike many times, ravaging [[House Dino]] each time.

In order to cure [[Lazuli Dino]], who was born afflicted and on the verge of succumbing, [[Golorr]] prescribed the [[S4]] utilizing the [[blackflame]] to contain it.

# Effects
The [[Curse|curse]] struck randomly on those who upheld the crown of the Kingdom, falling into mythos each time it did. Notably it was not a curse on the bloodline, as was believed by many powerful mages over the years, but rather a curse on the burden of rulership. 

When it fatally altered the host, they became a [[Dragonic whillo]].
## Staging
When it manifested, the curse went through multiple stages, as observed by [[Linnean Burgitsk]]. 
>[!quote|author ] Linnean Burgitsk
"The **First Stage** of the curse initiates upon birth with it, where the effects manifest lightly as temper tantrums and a growing unpleasantness about the host. It is unknown if this stage might manifest at later stages in life if the curse were to be transfused, but this has never been successfully performed in recorded history. Peculiarly, and for the rest of the curse’s lifespan, rain or lightning storms may form in recognition of the mood of one host to the First Stage, a form of [[Magic#Latent|latent]] reaction to the soul's ire.

> The **Second Stage** seems reached upon the threshold of 10 years of age, where red lightning may manifest across the body upon waking up in the morning or during sleep at night, and scales begin to swathe their way over the skin in subtle ways. It seems this is when the curse begins to take root in psychospace, and thusly reflects on the [[Plane#Realm|physical plane]] with a sort of growing plant of energy, the seeds of which were planted in the First Stage. It is unknown to me whether or not this plant changes form depending on the host. 
> 
> The **Third Stage** is when the curse is near completion, around the threshold of 18 years of age. Untreated here, the physical form of the accursed becomes closest to that of a dragon. A metallic tail erupts from the lower back, and drags about the ground as if it were a chain. The host has some level of control over this tail, but doing this is said to bring the host immeasurable pain. The curse can still be concealed here, but it is near impenetrable, and impossible not to notice the changes done to the temper and ideals of the accursed. Even here it seems a host may be incapable of controlling the energy discharged by the growing presence inside them. 
>
> It is the **Fourth Stage**, total metamorphosis, that is most dangerous, most incurable so it seems, when the transformation takes root and the whillo takes shape, control, and dominion over the host, assuring its permanence and the host’s damnation..."
