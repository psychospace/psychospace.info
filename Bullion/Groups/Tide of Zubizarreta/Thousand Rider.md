![[⎋ 2FPG]]
The **Thousand Rider** is a mysterious pale-faced knight who is incredibly wanted across the remnant of [[Bullion]] (as of [[1285 PT]]), as part of the [[Tide of Zubizarreta]]. Also called the “**Desert Rose**” or the **Pale Knight**, the doll-faced Thousand Rider is a highly dangerous warrior with unclear motivations, who has well-and-truly earned the ire of the [[Sganyodaiyo]].

The Rider appears to be infatuated with [[new magic]] sources of power, and this infatuation has clearly led to their own corruption and repulsing state of being.

# Appearance
Their body has two "arms", and four "legs", causing them to resemble an insectoid [[centaur]], with their ribs coming alive like a millipede's limbs. Their white, almost porcelain armor seems to calcify around their body like a shell, and her weapons seem to erupt from her flesh, crafted of what has been analyzed to likely be bone. 

Thick red blood is said to sometimes seep from the cracks in her armor, even though she will not appear wounded: left to evaporate, this sometimes leads to the propagation of [[Blood-flora|blood-flora]], a trait which suggests the Rider's present-day affliction comes from [[League of Joriele|Joriele]], as blood-flora is endemic to the region. 

Though only a handful of instances have ever seen her unmasked, her face seems to resemble a near-light-gray-skinned, five-eyed [[Elf#High elves|high elf]] with horns sweeping into her helmet, though three of her eyes are nearly blind. 

Parts of her skin have been intermittently described as "shattered" like a pane of glass, though nobody has gotten close enough to her to confirm such sightings. Her hair is platinum in tone, and always seems eerily clean.
## Namesake
It is widely believed that her^[Though pronouns of preference are unknown for this convict, the Rider is commonly identified as she/her, they/them, or it/its due to her bodily appearance.] real name is "*Rima Nullius*", according to a number of extant sources.

Her name as the "*Thousand Rider*" is earned from when the [[Blue Cinder Militia|militia]] attempted to create a thousand-man-long net to snag her, and she managed to outrun every last rider they sent for her.

# Abilities
The Rider is said to fight with an ethereal, alien grace, with impeccable strength and multiple masteries in weaponry to boot.  In part due to the variety of [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpins]] she may possess, the *sganyodaiyo* have repeatedly advised that engaging her is extremely dangerous, even when someone with [[shotcaller]] abilities is in play.

## Mycelial body 
They have the known ability to pull their consciousness into any disconnected piece of their body, and spread themselves like a fungus, an ability that enables their biomechanical existence. 

In addition, it appears from several instances that merely touching her is poisonous.

##  Thousand Bike
According to authorities, the Thousand Rider terrorizes the [[Aed & Maed]] aboard a biomechanical wheeled vehicle, with intestinal piping along the sides, and viscous viscera dripping from the teeth of the heavy, treaded wheels. This vehicle was evidently created through her body's chimeric fusion with a lynchpin device. Due to its approximate appearance to a large bicycle, it is known as the "**Thousand Bike**". 

According to some eyewitness accounts, the Rider uses a biological cable to tether herself to the device. The vehicle is said to roar like a mountain lion when accelerating, sometimes appearing from nothing and leaving a trail of red, spore-filled smoke wherever it travels.

# History 
The Rider first came to the [[The Shibboleth|Shibb]]'s attention in [[1283 PT]], when it is said she openly [[Burning of the Tuck farm|slaughtered]] the Tuck family and their visitors, burning their [[San Arias]] [[Tuck family farm|farm]] to the ground. Apparently, the Rider's target was Johanna Abascal (who was apparently in the possession of a lynchpin). 

Only one survivor of this incident is known about, with all physical evidence of the farm otherwise vanished by a severe [[Altercation|altercation]].
