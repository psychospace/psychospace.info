An **omen**, **omen child**, or **omen prodigy** is a class of usually sapient [[Creature|creatures]] born in the years surrounding [[Zero Day]]. An omen is set aside from its peers by its impeccable (and often inconvenient) genetic [[Magic|magic]], powers, or traits, far and away above other examples of their kind. 

Their births occurred within an unknown interval. Those born before [[1251 PT]] were later understood to be the first [[Broadcaster|Broadcasters]], and were some of the first indications of the existence of [[New Magic|new magic]]. The true meaning or reason for their birth is unknown, surely related to the events of Zero Day in some fashion.

Omens, like Broadcasters, are known to be drawn powerfully to one another's influence.

Omens were often born aware of greater factors in [[Universe|reality]], such as the [[Gift of Stars]]. They were also known for generally bearing bioluminescent [[bright eyes]], as well as [[Logic|luck]] unlike their peers.
