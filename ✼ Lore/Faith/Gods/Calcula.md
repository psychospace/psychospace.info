**Calcula** is a [[Divinity|god]], son of [[Cientia]] with no known father, overseeing the [[domain]] of construction and defense. 

Followers of Calcula believe him to have no father because he is a sort of homunculus, representing the protection of society and advancement of defenses as a natural response to the formation of civilization. He is sometimes represented by bats.

Proverbial "brother" to [[Renthe]], born around the same time.

Had two daughters with [[Bioh]], goddess of nature, which war with each other. These children are [[Lex|Eriva]] and [[Ordo|Tegra]].
