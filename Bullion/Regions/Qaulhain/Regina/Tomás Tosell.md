**Tom√°s Tosell Abasolo** is an [[Omen|omen child]] who was raised at the [[Lavas Hideaway]]. 


# History
Born in early [[1240 PT]], at some point he was taken to the Hideaway by the mysterious "[[R. S. Langford|doc]]". 

From high up on [[Mount Lavas]], he would watch over travelers using an ever-burning pine tree to indicate his presence, throwing his voice and picking up other sounds on the air.

In [[1249 PT]], at age 9, Tosell introduced himself to the victims of the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]] when they were investigating the region.

# Ability
Tosell possessed no [[body]] to speak of, and thus acted similar to a [[Ghost|ghost]], speaking only in sounds on the wind, and being effectively invulnerable to damage. However, this ability severely limited his physical interactions, requiring him to manipulate [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]] in order to do most normal things.
