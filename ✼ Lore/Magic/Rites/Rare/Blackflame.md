**Blackflame**, materially, was a powerful emotional [[Magic|magic force]] created by pieces of the corpse of the [[Divinity|god]] [[Arizhmiya]]. Spiritually, it was divine flame birthed by [[Cientia]] and [[Athemat]]. It was the grudge borne of a pastless world seeking to forge new history, enabling such feats and generating interest in it by extant, malicious forces.

As the origin point of [[Arahabaki]], blackflame was capable of containing the [[Dragonic Curse]], and it could also be contacted by those who drew close to Arizhmiya. 
# History

When [[Arizhmiya#History|Lagacia]], god of the past, was born, its [[body]] was composed of an infinite divine black fire, which could be fed with ash but could not be quenched. Even when Lagacia degenerated into its shade form, [[Arizhmiya]], the flame would not die, as a result of tragic pity taken on the god by the [[Anti|Ignition Point]].  Sparks of the blackflame are said to have created the stars, while the parentage became the gods [[Cientia]] and [[Athemat]].

The blackflame was the fire that hatched the eggs of [[Sakuya and Ninigi]], the ancient dragons who used Sacred as a nesting ground. From them were born several irregular children: notably, [[Arahabaki|Umisachi]] and its parasitic twin [[Uforia|Yamasachi]].

As a direct result of it being its own origin point, the blackflame can contain the fragments of Arahabaki's grudge that have degenerated into the [[curse]]. The past contains the future inside its potential.

The angels contained both embers known to them in the [[Aet'Caldwyn|Lightstream Fortress]]. The two specimens combined are known as the [[Invertebra]].
