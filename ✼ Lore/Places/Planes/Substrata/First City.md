The **First City**, sometimes called by its formal names **Great Concord**, **Axis**, or **Harmonia**, is an immortal settlement within the [[the Fortress]] which anchors it to the Planet. 

Home of several avatars of [[ Divinity|gods]], and of their [[Logic|law itself]], it forms the concrete anchor of [[chaos]] and [[gravity]] as they affect the planet, as well as the only place where both [[Worldline|worldlines]] flow simultaneously. 

The City is located at the "midway point" between [[the Heavens]] and its [[elseworld|dual]], and its existence supposedly prevents the influence of the [[Chartless Sea]] over the [[Antic Sea|whole system]].

Legends say the Orrery, an [[Antique|artifact]] which endlessly evaluates and improves the [[Divine Equation]], dwells within the First City.

# Properties
The First City is a massive, mathematically-perfect, gorgeous city, inside a colossal [[Not-where|pocket]] of the Fortress, sometimes said to be at the core of [[the Planet]].

It is physically located on a [[remnant|islet]] in a gleaming bay of flowing [[Echo|psychic data]], whose raw form resembles [[water]]. Its sky is replete with equal amounts of both [[Starfall|day and night]], and its weather always feels just right.

Since [[the Gathering]], the merged elements of [[wood]] and [[metal]] have been fundamental components of the City, as a result of the incorporation of [[Umbraid]] and [[V채r채h]] into its makeup. As a direct result, the city's buildings do not cleanly resemble a mortal city, a chimeric combination of all [[Elemental energy|elemental axes]]. 

Contrary to the implication of this harmony with nature, the six axioms are all organized algorithmically, naturally, and carefully to form mediality. This paints the picture of a city which defies [[Chaos]] by its very distortion and organization of it.

Following [[Zero Day]], though, the subduction has slipped and these planes have returned to the [[The Planet#Planar stack|planar stack]], reducing the influence of "crime" caused by their [[Elemental creatures|elementals]] on the city.

## Connections
Two bridges extend out from the City over the bay of data, directed along the magnetic polarity of the planet. As one walks along a bridge, the bridges distort into gorgeous rainbows which bend into the horizon line, splitting into all known bands of light and becoming [[Portal|portals]], so travelers might return to their home [[Plane|planes]]. 

Through the First City, the entire "dual" [[Plane#Sphere|spheres]] of [[psychospace]] and [[necrospace]] are said to be connected to the divine spire which dwells in [[Unwri]], and from there to the [[Kibangan|firmament]]. However, many in elseworld have reasons to doubt that the connection to their own worldline has been maintained.

## Population

The City's primary and native denizens are [[engram|engrams]]. These creatures, as well as the city and, supposedly, lynchpins altogether, are constructed by native [[monitor|monitors]] known as [[Harmon|Harmoni]]. Many gods are said to live here and many of those aware of the Fortress have found retirement or trade within the plane to be comfortable.

Some of its native population are [[Petitioner|petitioners]].

# History
In legend, the First City is named as such because it was the very first settlement which the gods constructed on the planet. Indeed, if [[Anti]] anchored chaos and gravity to this point, other immortal infrastructure would soon emerge around that anchor-point (supposedly the Orrery), and the Fortress is one of the (if not the most) ancient plane connected to the Planet.

The City supposedly emerged into its proper state during the Gathering, when V채r채h and Umbraid were bound inside it to prevent the collusion of chaos.

## Modernity
Following [[Zero Day]], the fabric of the Fortress began to weaken, as did the First City's in turn (though it was substantially stronger than its surroundings). This led to more and more Harmoni vanishing through holes in the tapestry into the physical universe, and subsequently influencing the planar stack while returning home, causing the births of [[aphorite|aphorites]]. 

Around that time, it was known that [[Amanita Parasom|Amanita]] and [[Octavia Parasom]] fled into the First City as part of their self-imposed rehabilitation. Sometime later, after a short gunfight with [[Arthur Graywell]], they were recaptured by the [[Order of Hope]] to be tried and sentenced for their crimes, leading to their executions, as [[Reincarnation|reincarnation]] was the only means of cleansing their sins.

The return of the planes of metal and wood to the stack caused many of the more "chaos-made-orderly" aspects of the city to fade, forcing Harmoni to turn their attentions inward and repair the damages done by the [[Sky-scrape|sky-scrape]], which appeared to tunnel directly through their realm's bridges. Other immortals also have begun to emerge into the plane, though their intentions remain inscrutable by the greater world.

# Views
Despite this holy and important status, not all lawful gods dwell in Harmonia, preferring [[Mana (plane)|Mana]]. In fact, if the First City is said to stabilize those of chaos that live there, given the divinity's broad disdain for Chaos, that would incentivize them making their homes there. 

In other words, something must be wrong with dwelling in Harmonia.

[[Viers Callinan]] observed that Harmonia may be a place of equal footing for both the gods and their less-savory others, such as [[Outsider|Outsiders]], provided they conform to the law that makes up this plane. The City could be their ['false front'](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village) to present to the [[universe]] at large, to cover up errors their law has previously made: hiding their failure with managing the elseworld, the necessity of the Gathering to prevent defeat of their rule, or similar such mistakes.
