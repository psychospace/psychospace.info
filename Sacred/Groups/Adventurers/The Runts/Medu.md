**Medu** is a [[Human]] cleric of life working with [[The Runts]] as its first mate. Medu is something of a strange one, speaking in semi-broken Common, but is always ready to show compassion to a creature who needs it. She freaks out and becomes violent, or at least seemingly overreacts, when abandoned without explanation.

Instead of sourcing her power from a specific deity, she researches psychology and sources the strength from her knowledge of the will to live in general, the power of the domain itself. She does however carry a small talisman of [[Imagi]], which she calls a "wayfinder" back to her adoptive mother.

She wears an enchanted piece of half-plate called a "life vest" (or, to the more studied eye, a [[Survival Mantle]]).


# History 
She was abandoned first by her family and second by her orphan friends at a young age in a dungeon outside [[Miraclesfield]]. She was eventually properlty raised by [[Noella]]. The kindness shown to the girl changed Medu forever for the better, even if that kindness was from an alien being.

As a young girl, she read the orphanage director's wizarding books for fun, a skill only reinforced by her training with Noella.

[[Hikawera]], often abused and mentally tormented for their body until they found their escape in being an adventurer, confides in and relates to Medu, and the girl was first to join the triton's [[The Runts|party]] upon their landfall in Sacred.
