Much like the real-world, **fire** is a [natural process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire) which produces heat from the consumption of fuel. Within [[the Heavens]], fire is an [[elemental energy]], associated with warmth, vitality, transformation, and light. ^a9cdc3

Magically, fire is a force of defined [[chaos]], forming one of the four fundamental axioms of nature, along with [[water]], [[air]], and [[earth]]. The [[Plane#Realm|realm]] of fire for [[the Planet]], where its most potent power lies, is known to be the [[Scarlet Skies]].

Fire describes the power of the vital spark within the [[soul]], which differentiates it from any other organism, but also describes this notion as compared to [[psychospace]]. When [[‚óç The World Born in Stone|the world was born in stone]], Anti granted the still-and-stagnant remains of the [[old world]] a "blazing fire of identity", allowing them to move once more.

Fire is partly believed to be the endpoint of [[vitality energy]], its most potent form. Its fusion with [[earth]] forms the basis of [[metal]].
