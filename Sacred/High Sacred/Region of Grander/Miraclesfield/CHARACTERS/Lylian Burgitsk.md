**Lylian Burgitsk** is a [[Human]] paladin; one of the daughters of [[House Burgitsk]]. She is of the same generation as the current royal officiant [[Mistral Taylor Burgitsk]], but a great deal younger. Despite her bravery, she is only about 23 years old, younger than her half-brother [[Volk Vendleberg|Volk]] by 2 years.

She is a 10th-level crown paladin.

# History
A childhood friend of the prince [[Lazuli Dino|Linnaeus]], Lylian traveled with him on more than one occasion, idolizing him.

Following their separation from most of House Burgitsk's [[Burgitsk Houseguard|honor guard]] just before their arrival in [[Rainbow Ridge]], Lylian sent [[Wandar Burgitsk|Wandar]], her mother, a letter regarding her trip to [[Puzzledam]] to hold her safely until the storm passed. Secretly, though, suspicious of [[Ikabod Caruso]], she conducted investigations into him during the half-month the first arc took place in.

This led to her, at one point, finding a single page by sneaking into his tower: *Dragonic Research - Entry 4*. Though she knew not what "[[Dragonic Curse|curse]]" afflicted Linnaeus, she now knew that Ikabod had [[Visitant|cloned]] the prince.

Once [[Red Spark|the Summit]] occurred, Lylian and [[Drachedion Balthazar|Balthazar]] both learned of what happened to the Prince, which caused her suspicions to grow all the more when Ikabod was reported missing and the Prince had not only been kidnapped, but had caved to some form of curse. A letter from her was sent to [[Gekthús]] early the following month: she was going to find Ikabod and find out what he'd done to Linnaeus for herself.

When the party arrived in [[Lond Point]] for their second major circuit in [[1251 PT]], Lylian was about to leave for [[Miraclesfield]], searching for the visitants. Under the alias "Sinipoki", she tried to learn about [[Lyrica]]. Shortly thereafter, she was beaten to the punch by the [[S4]], who had also recruited [[Lethal]]. Following the events of the [[Miraclesfield Experiment]], she pursued [[Lithop]] into the south, but her scent was caught onto by [[Volk Vendleberg|Volk]].
