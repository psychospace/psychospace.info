**Fennelly Pteronautics, Co.** is a [[airship|shipbuilding]] company out of [[Aschalas]] in [[Sirrhad]], [[Bullion]]. An up-and-coming player in the airship industry, they were founded in [[1277 PT]] by a previous executive of the [[Arkwright Improvement Company]], [[Jam Fennelly|Javier "Jam" Fennelly, II]].

It is unknown to the general public why it is that Jam Fennelly left ImCo to found his own company, partially in competition with ImCo's [[Lainese Heavy Industries|parent outfit]]. Fennelly cited distaste for [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qauli]] business politics, as well as a desire to make his name last in the eyes of the world.

Fennelly operates an [[Insight & Opportunity]] division.
