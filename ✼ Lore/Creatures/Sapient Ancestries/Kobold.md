**Kobolds**, also known as **dragonborn**, are a hardy ancestry of #sapient peoples who venerate their ancient powers as related to [[Dragon|dragons]]. 

Short-statured with long tails, the scale-skinned and cold-blooded kobolds are born in eggs, reach adulthood by age 12, and most grow to be around 50 or 60. Kobolds have long coincided with their guardian, [[Gebra]], and its domains of mythos, power, and precaution. A group of kobolds is called a **kabal**.

# Culture

Among the many sapient races of [[The Heavens|The Heavens]], kobolds have a history of acting in strong self-preservation, often yielding immediately to historical changes-of-the-guard. They can back this history up through their strong candidacy for being the most ancient ancestry of humanoid-like peoples active to this day, with some of their ruins being older even than the [[Elf|elves]]. Kobolds often list their surname ahead of their name, a practice which reinforces their dedication to history.

Their communities and colonies, numerous in the undergrounds and caves of most [[Remnant|remnants]], generally revere dragonkin, [[Antique|artifacts]], gifted casters, or places of holy import. When such a place becomes a gathering spot for a kabal, that source of power is idolized as their **Taker**, as they have captured the collective minds of the group. The taker in turn gains a unique magical advantage, as the [[Psinomenon|psinomenon]] from this kabal's veneration empowers them. Iconoclasts of koboldom, mostly inventors or cartographers, might lead their clans towards these targets whenever circumstances become too difficult. 

When working in teams, kobolds feel extremely secure, creating many "fangs" (weapons) to outwit and work past their disadvantages as a collective. "Slow fangs", the term used by kobolds for any traps they invent, are often obtuse, but are just as often devastating, especially when leveraged with the blessing of and a kobold's fortified responsibility to a Taker. 

Most kobolds, however, are ultimately (and rather famously) weak of temperament, owing to a natural prey-like instinct, and will turn and run if things seem doomed or desperate. The telltale yipping, barking, and jabbering in [[Draconic]] of kobolds as they scatter from their Taker is a common experience to the early work of an adventurer.

In the past 100 years (as of [[‚çü Magical Mystery Tour]]), in accordance with the [[Age of Adventurers]], kobolds in the Wild Blue have been gradually emerging from their holdouts to strive to much more dangerous things and treasures, as well as expressing yet more complex desires and philosophies. Cultural shifts in the treatments of many ancestries have benefitted kobolds as well,  though their genuine deep-seated trust of dragons makes them more than culpable to poor judgements in leadership, aim, or outlook.


# Mythos
Mythology follows that kobolds were born somehow of the [[soulstone|soulstones]] that fell to the [[Wild Blue Yonder]] and [[Scarlet Skies]] from Gebra's reborn body. Kobold origin myths diverge from this point, some believing that they were born from these stones as eggs and thus possess sparks of divinity, others believing that it was the [[First Magicians|First Ones]]' attempts to recreate dragons using these stones that generated their bodies, as though they were speakers of the gods. Some further elaborate that perhaps these stones were melted down or gradually eroded into the earth, steeping the power that made them into the core of the remnants. 

Like many other races, their propensity for magic and divine traits was challenged by [[The Gathering]], conveying a powerful warning to them to not exceed their grasp, a warning that has carried through to the modern day.
