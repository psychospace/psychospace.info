**Witchcraft** is a [[Magic|magical]] study, specifically focused in on internalized connections to external forces. **Witches**, also known as **warlocks**, are the users of witchcraft. 

They are among the most ancient [[Magic]]-casters whose work survives today, perhaps because it is so base to reality. A group of witches or warlocks is known as a **coven**. 

Traditionally female and traditionally demonized, and widely mythologized, any person can find themselves toiling in witchcraft.

# Institutions
Due to the unpredictable nature of patron forces, most academic study of witchcraft relies on control, or efforts like [[antimagic|antimagically]] suppressing the influence of these forces.

Some of the more commonly known institutions who support the free practice of witchcraft include large, multi-remnantal covens, such as the [[Coven of the Night]].

 Thaumaturges often find their work coinciding with much of the study of witchcraft, as both focus in on esoterica.

Witchcraft is often called the fundaments of [[reality-bending]], a process the craft calls *reckoning*, and such falls under the ironic moniker of [[new magic]] as its use becomes more proliferated. Officially, witchcraft is partly a clade of new-magic.
