***Syzygy*** was the third arc of [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]].

In *Syzygy*, all eyes are trained on the party's journeys to assemble the [[Golorr|Stone of Golorr]], an artifact which supposedly holds the hidden origins of the curse. As each of Ikabod's experiments are [[Lithop|finding]] [[Lyrica|themselves]], and old enemies crop up left and right, the hammer of the Heartknock fully unveils their role in the war effort during the [[Miraclesfield Experiment]]. ^63e7ba

# Wote (2)
### 2-1-1251

%%Late session 47, 48, 49, and the start of session 50 take place.%%

### 2-2-1251
Volk is contacted by [[ELIZ]] to do investigating of a nearby quarry, a [[Rollingstone Mining Company]] project that was abandoned in [[1238 PT]]. In that quarry is a [[Runic engine#Faults|runic engine bomb]] that was set off in 1250 PT to produce the first purple storm. He is rained out by the ghost storm from Miraclesfield.

%%2-3-1251 ???%%


### 2-4-1251
Volk is no longer rained out; he travels across the [[Victory Canyon]], stopping at the ruins of the *[[Caged Bird]]*. After investigating for a while, he was dropped in on by [[Octavia Parasom|Kingdle Coal]], and his blood surged, causing him to temporarily lose conscious thought.

### 2-5-1251
Volk awakens in the caves the morning after. Volk hunted for any evidence in the quarry, using his new coat to stand out in the rain freely, and discovered that the Heartknock was definitely here at some point, but found very little evidence of things being moved around. He backtracked to try and find the *Bird* again, but there was no sign nor clue of the ship having taken off or been dragged away: it just vanished.
