**Wraithswords** and **wraith weapons** are a class of [[Antique|artifact]] which held together and bound the islands of the [[Colossal Ocean]] in a sort of "mass of souls". These weapons were powerful artifacts which had offered each place their own sovereignty separate from each other. They appeared to, like [[Remnant|remnants]], cause whatever they were stuck in to defy [[Gravity|gravity]].
