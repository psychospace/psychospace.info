**Logan Caruso** was a [[human]] who gave his name to [[Logan's Bastion]], his base. He was an ancestor of [[Ikabod Caruso]]. From Ikabod's perspective, Logan was a great great great grand-uncle.

As noted by [[Viers Callinan]], Logan, a human in love with an elf, was obsessed with the ancient world, often searching for fragments of forgotten history in the guts of the remnant, finding interest, if not compensation, in the architecture of a remnant's inner core, where phantasms form. In his lab he often created skeletal test-creatures, capable of digging through the earth with their bare hands, custom built from the bones of many different creatures. Intentional or not, the man became a necromancer.
