**The Gathering** was a major epoch of [[âœ¼ Timeline Hub|history]] spanning the 25,000 years between BPT 525,000 and BPT 500,000 which resulted in the creation of the "planar stack", a defining trait of the modern [[The Heavens|Heavens]]'s cosmology.

# History

After the [[Age of the Gods|birth of a new pantheon]], [[Elemental energy]] gathered together as earth, fire, water, and air were redefined and reinvented by the new position of [[Chaos]] in this new ecosystem. Most [[Remnant|remnants]] were occupied by loose colonies of infantile [[Psychospace|psychospacial]] imprints of the last world known as [[Echo|echoes]], memories of old things which used to exist. 

The most powerful colonies shared in and began to hoard the elemental forces, seeking definition for themselves, becoming [[elder elementals]]. Many of these elder elementals corroded and split into two paths: modern [[alpha elementals]], and [[Whill|whills]], who sought to exert command over the [[First Magicians]].

The massive outbreak of these forces collectively permanently altered the equilibrium states in psychospace. 

To try and prevent the new reality from succumbing to chaos's power [[War of Chaos|as its predecessor had]], the [[Divinity|gods]] etched a layer-structure into the [[The Heavens]], creating permanent buffer zones between the whills and preventing collaboration. Apparently, in the course of this, the [[Calamity of the Eyes]] occurred as well.

When this did not suffice, as an absolute safety measure, the gods made a pact with the [[Outsider|Outsiders]] to forge binds on time and space, known as [[Lynchpin Device|Lynchpin Devices]], whose eminent existence prevented meddling (yet assured temporary alterations) in the world's [[Logic]]. Tenets of this pact caused the bleeding of the elemental chaos of water into space, forming the [[Dark Sea]].

Though the true end and finalization of these changes, and thus the end of the Gathering, remains a subject of conjecture, most historians agree that it was the [[Breaking of Sacred]] that brought the cotemporaneous [[Age of the Gods]] to an end.
