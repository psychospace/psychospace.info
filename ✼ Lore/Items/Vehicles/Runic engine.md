description: A runic engine is a module, invented by Nortia, that can enable an airship to travel faster and farther usingthe Sheer.
---
A **runic engine** is an apparatus invented by [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] in [[1243 PT]] to facilitate much faster [[Airship]] travel using [[Rune|runic]] [[magic]] and a conduit created using [[The Sheer]]. It is comprised of the primary module (the **rune projector**) and a secondary module mounted to the underside of a vessel (the **conduit apparatus**).

# Function
The engine functions as a terrestrial equivalent of a lightspeed jump. 
1. Using electricity and [[Lux]], an apparatus generates clouds that surround a vessel. 
2. Through alignment by an operating runic engineer, the rune projector creates runes on these clouds. An engineer doesn't write runes to a specific place, just how far to jump.
3. When the runes are each illustrated, the rune projector consumes a great deal of energy to punch a teleportation circle in the [[Cloudscape]], which opens a rough, simplistic collapsed-space conduit through the Sheer that the vessel can enter through.
4. The conduit then slams shut, causing the vessel to be jettisoned forward the indicated distance. This process can take several subjective minutes depending on the vessel.

At the time of the [[Dragonic War]], a runic engine can't jump more than about 10 miles at a time, but that still massively outspeeds anything when the movement is instantaneous, only takes about 5 minutes to fire up (provided the special fuel is provided), and is hidden by its own effect (it makes clouds).

## Faults
Due to active maintenance of a Sheer portal, and the overall replicability of the engine's internals, a catastrophic portal destabilization can occur if the runes are not aligned before the Sheer conduit opens. In the worst instances, this can result in a *[[The Sheer#Wildcat destabilization|wildcat destabilization]]*. ^379ec2
