The so-called **Unknown Era** is a prehistoric era which followed the [[War of Chaos]], and precipitated the [[Age of the Gods]].

Very little context can be discerned of the world at this time, hence its name; in it, the [[Antic Sea]] apparently bounced back from the brink it was pushed to during the War. 

It is said that certain [[Antique|artifacts]], such as the [[Apocrypha of Winds]], took their present shape in this timeframe.

# Conjectural History
The scant details reveal that the clash between the Maker and Unmaker formed a rough sort of bedrock upon which the “rules” of this universe began to take shape once again. 

As mythological retellings go, at the end of the War of Chaos, [[the Maker]] had succeeded in its goal, as had [[the Unmaker]]. For whatever reason, all conflict resolved in stalemates, and the two meta-consciousnesses met themselves in the middle, and became the *same* -- fusing into the same being. But as they looked around, all they saw was [[The Heavens|a broken world in an endless sky]]. Not destroyed or created, but irrevocably transformed into a pile of pieces.

With their goals achieved, however, the Maker vanished into thin air. Its fused remains, known as [[Anti]], would form the basis of the [[divinity]] which would come to furnish the dying universe.
