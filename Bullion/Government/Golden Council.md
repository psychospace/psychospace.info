The **Golden Council** is the ruling group of five emirs whose cooperation creates and perpetuates the [[Emirate of Qaulhain]]. Attended to by various other groups and individuals, four of the emirs are elected by right from each region of Qaulhain -- Laina, Alpoa, Somar, and Derya -- and they individually must unilaterally find a leader, a **Golden Emir** who guides most of their efforts.

The structure of the Council is principally designed on the [[Emirate of Qaulhain#Union of Lamgama|Union of Lamgama]], who brought the individual tribes of Qaulhain into line and guided them spiritually to a brighter future.

The present Golden Emir is [[Es'kys Uliiz]].
