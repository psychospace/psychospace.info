The **Aed & Maed** is a geographic region of [[Bullion]], most of which is occupied by the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]]. It constitutes the north-middle of the remnant, where the [[Luminaria]] seats their power in the highlands, flanked on all sides by grassy plains where farms and small townships reign.

This geography was once home to the ancient society of [[Ith'Paraan]], and the modern state lays claim to most of its ruins.

It consists of the [[Aedil Plains]] and the [[Maedil Plains]], as well as some of the areas in between bordering on the [[Upper Kernwelt]] to the south.

"Aed & Maed" is a common saying for expressing exasperation or dismay.
