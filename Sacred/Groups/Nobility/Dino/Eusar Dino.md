**Eusar Triassa Cresta Dino** was the elder brother of [[Hadro Dino]]. He succumbed to the [[Dragonic Curse]] in 1062 and was killed shortly after becoming king, leaving his brother to take the role. It is said that he was king for but a day.

Eusar was born in [[1044 PT]] to [[Spino Dino]] and [[Megal Triassa]]. He died in [[1062 PT]], killed with [[Dinofang]].

This is the last recorded occurrence of the curse in memory. Per request of the [[House Burgitsk|Burgitsk family]], the curse was removed from his tale, and fell into mythology..
