**Jakoby Cutler** was a rougish dark [[Elf]], trained to be a master assassin, one of the last taught by the [[Father Knife]] in [[Umazia]]. He lived without a last name for much of his life, and was an ally of [[Critical Hit]], through [[Nery Ravenna]], a childhood friend.

Jakoby perished tragically during one of the later ventures of Critical Hit, due to a [[Catharia Incident|mistake]] made in intel by [[Ikabod Caruso]]. Jakoby's family, with the family name Cutler, live in [[Drastic]], and he had one son and two daughters with the human woman Winn Daalia. A grave marker is placed within the Lifestone Garden to mark him, but his body was never recovered from [[Catharia]].
