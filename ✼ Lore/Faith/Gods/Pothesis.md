Also called "the Sinners Become Sin", **Pothesis** is the [[Divinity|god]] of [[Demon|demons]], and thus, de facto god of [[The Abyss]]. He is also the god of blood, and often considered the god of war. Whenever a demon is created from numerous souls of sinners, they are the god to oversee the process.
