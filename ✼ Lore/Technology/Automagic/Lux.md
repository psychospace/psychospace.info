**Lux** is a transversal arcane fluid which can give power to many types of machines, created using [[Vibe]]. Its utility, summarized, begins and ends with its ability to affect [[Psychospace|psychospace]] while being outside its origin, allowing it to fuel [[automagic]]. 

However, lux is transitory, and highly dangerous if used incorrectly. For this reason, it is mostly used by [[Magic|magical]] researchers, who have the facilities and infrastructure necessary for ensuring lux's safe processing.

# Synthesis
Lux must first be synthesized by a windmill-like apparatus known as a **lux convertor** (powered by [[vis]]) using [[Vibe]] from the surrounding area, and that Vibe must be saturated with [[Light (property)|Light]] for it to properly craft lux. The converter draws the fluid out of psychospace while it remains in motion, in either gaseous or liquid form.

The convertor must take in Vibe of such purity that [[Mana|mana]] will not form, nor the Vibe lose its purity when it is taken onto [[The Planet|Yalagnu]]. If successful, lux takes its intended liquid form.

Lux is not often generated naturally, due to the number of conditions that must be met to synthesize it. However, it is likely that small amounts of lux can be naturally generated from the casting of any spell. Only when controlling the magical processes does it become possible to synthesize lux in such a manner that it becomes useful.

Once synthesized, lux must be moved through **lux pipes**. Lux's existence, being a transversal material, requires a [[contiguator]].

# Nox
Lux left to stagnate, similar to the real-world process of water stagnation, will lose its ability to return to psychospace in its original form, turning impure and [[Light (property)#Darkness|Dark]].

Stagnant lux, or lux created of impure Vibe (also called "nox" or "dark lux"), draws wayward [[Undead]], as they enjoy devouring the wishes of the living in any form. A lux outbreak, common in ruins with many machines, and called "luthir", is said to "whisper" for this reason, as the collective consciousness's voices may be enough to reach physical reality.

It is known that stagnant lux may be used in the creation of [[Familiar|familiar]] or other dark-aligned [[Figment|figment]] creatures, due to sharing properties with [[Echo|echoes]].
