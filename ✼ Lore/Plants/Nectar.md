**Nectar** is the street-name for a drug made from the petals of a [[mawflower]], a carnivorous plant, which is used for [[Alchemy|alchemical]] or therapeutic purposes. 

# Use
To imbibe it, the inside of the petal sticks to your tongue, then gradually melts into sugar (akin to cotton candy) over the course of about an hour. The petal itself is left over and surprisingly sanitary, occasionally discarded or used for tea.

## Effects
The effects of nectar are largely hallucinogenic and numbing. The sensation, while subjective, has been commonly described like a cool drink on a warm summer's day, allowing the host to relax into their present situation. 

Upsetting or stressing someone under the effects of nectar is dangerous: on top of the dulled sense of pain, the positive mental effects may turn into a deep unsettling dread.

# Legal status
Though legally-scrutinized, it remains “legal in practice” in places such as [[Bullion]], especially for members of the [[Sganyodaiyo]] or other [[Wildwalker|gaucho]]. It originates from elven practice, and was originally used by their tacticians to recoup a bit of their grace while under pressure.
