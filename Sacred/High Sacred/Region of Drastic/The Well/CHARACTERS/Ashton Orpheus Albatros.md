Also known as "**Ace of Gold**" or AJ to his friends, **Ashton Orpheus Albatros, Jr.** is an aristocrat of [[The Well]].

He owns  [[The Leprechaun's Haul]] casino in The Well, and acts as the historian of the [[Gold Clock Society]]. A dark-skinned man born into money with a peculiar natural blondeness, his peculiar taste in women, yet to be quenched, has led to many a tale being propagated across the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] of women finding themselves taken aback by Ashton's anonymous handsomeness only for him to charm them, turn them down, and leave them starved for more.

Under the persona of "Ace of Gold" he steals his way into the night and tasks himself with extinguishing evil across his city, not unlike Batman. Perhaps he knows his secret identity will make it difficult for him to keep a spouse.

As for proper companionship, he keeps a tabby thrymm named [[Ingot (thrymm)|Ingot]], who often patrols the streets of The Well on his behalf. He also keeps a wolfhound named [[Aurum (pet)|Aurum]], which acts as his ranger companion.

He is about 23 years old at present, his father, Ashton the First, was the inaugurator of the "Ace" persona.
