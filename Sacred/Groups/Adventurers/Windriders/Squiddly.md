**Squiddly** is a red [[Tiefling]] ranger with a dramatic streak, a member of the [[Adinah Ilacqua|Windriders]]. Wears an eyepatch since he can't wink and it helps his aim, even though he still has both eyes. He rarely thinks before he makes a move. Squiddly is about 30, although he lost count after he turned 18. He tells everyone he's only 19.

Originally from the remnant of [[Umazia]], Squiddly survived the harsh realities of working under Nortia's bootheel only barely with the help of Jenks and Nat. Under Umazian rhetoric, which pushes tieflings to deny their own bloodline, Squiddly worked as an acolyte to a temple to a god he did not choose, near to the Darkzone. As a result, he hates reading and has a special dislike for priests who do nothing with their faith (although he only harbors a slight distaste for clerics and paladins, although he still scoffs at the thought of trusting any god with your life).



Like many tieflings of Umazia, Squiddly's tail was cut when he was very young, preventing its regrowth.
