A **visitant** is an artificial [[figment]] crafted with only a fragment of a [[soul]] , given the ability to think and to live by carving out the collective consciousness through direct injections of [[Vibe]]. 

A visitant can be created of nearly any [[creature]] for whom remains exist, though the natural impetus behind creating a visitant is to understand the soul used to craft it, digging deeper into inner emotions, ancient history, and truths.

Though they likely existed in various forms beforehand, the first visitants to go by that name were created in [[1250 PT]] by [[Ikabod Caruso]], using his [[Ikabod's surrogate soul|eponymous spell]], who used it to recreate [[Certain (evangel)|Certain]]. The most well-known visitants are those which Caruso created of [[Lazuli Dino]], including [[Lyrica]], [[Lithop]], [[Lacuna]], [[Lethal]], [[Lucent]], [[Locket]], and [[Pendant]].

# Surrogacy
To be created, a visitant must have some element of origination: the closer to the original this element is, the better. Even [[Echo|echoes]] will suffice, though the process will be extremely difficult. Ikabod Caruso, for example, recreated an [[evangel]] Certain using a recovered fossil.

A visitant does not begin conscious or complete. It must receive regular care in order for its surrogate soul and individuated body to form. In order to complete its soul, typically time must pass and their young mind must mature, similar to the length of time of childbirth.

Until that point, they lie motionless with major brain activity, as if dreaming while asleep. Certain magics, such as the [[Lifeblinding|mark of lifeblind]], bypass the wait, though at some risk to the caster.

When a visitant completes their soul, it is largely a matter of conjecture how the soul will appear. Some say that aspects of the soul cannot be alienated when their form is changed, causing the soul's fragments to take on or adapt the appearance of its original source. Other hypotheses state that because the process relies on instinct, it will only ever replicate the original soul, and that differences between visitants of the same being rely only on environmental differences.

## Trauma response
Visitants still in this dream-like state are capable of reacting to trauma by suddenly instantiating the rest of their soul as their incomplete mind perceives it, should the soul come into danger. This instantiation process is only activated by instinct, and is similar to the safety measures that many animals have when faced with adversity. 

This occurred for each of Lazuli's visitants when the [[Red Spark]] resulted in the destruction of the *[[Ivan's Tiger]]*. This rapidly completes the soul, allowing it to immediately think, move (though so rapidly and unpredictably it is tantamount to [[Portal|teleportation]]), and escape danger. 

However, this "panic mode" causes later memory, perception, and bleedthrough issues which can lead to lasting psychological and physical damage, deemed by Caruso as "aftershocks" of such a process. Without the opportunity to individuate from the origin point, the visitant may feel discomforted and incomplete.

# Appearance
An odd effect of a visitant is in its [[Soul bond|psychospacial relation]] to its "original" soul. When someone views a visitant, they are viewing a creature with matching fragment of another soul, and thus, similar to how the visitant's mind works, the external viewpoint will "[[Bias coagulation|fill in the gaps]]" in its understanding of a person, causing inconsistencies in perception. In other words, since someone is only viewing "part" of a soul, their appearances can vary wildly between those who see them.

Should an external viewer ever become emotionally and psychically closer to the original soul that fragment came from, the resemblance between that person and the visitant will begin to seem uncanny in retrospect, impossible to deny, similar to a twin sibling. However, should the person be distant and uncaring of the original, they will seem as different as two unrelated people.

The extent to which the effects on perception manifest are unknown at present, but they do cause emotional duress, the external viewpoint sometimes being incapable of separating the original from the visitant in their memories.
