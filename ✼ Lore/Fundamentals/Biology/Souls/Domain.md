Instead of a [[Soul|soul]], [[Immortal|immortals]] possess a **domain** (sometimes called **duties**, **aspects**, or **portfolio**) which ensures they cannot truly ever [[Death|die]]. The domain is defined by a specific part of reality^[Specifically a tract of the [[Divine Equation]] (what mortals call [[Psychic code|psychic code]])] that the immortal then *must* wield and represent as a tool, as an immense [[Magic#intent|magical power]]. 

Unlike a soul, a domain isn't a tangible or individual thing: more of a body of thoughts and interrelated concepts. Many immortals might be defined by the same tract, but each immortal has a unique [[True name (concept)|true name]]. The influence an immortal has on its domain is known as its **monstrance**, and this influence need not be direct or conscious on the immortal's part.

The domain binds to an immortal's [[Body|body]] through a medium akin to the [[Silver cord|silver cord]], though instead of [[Vitality energy|positive energy]], the medium draws power from [[Psychospace|psychospace]] as a whole^[Usually a specific kind of energy, related to its domain.]. 

If an immortal ever fails to make use of their domain or answer expectantly to a higher power, they would be recycled into a new being in a pattern almost like a type of death. This destruction of the self to be remade is the only thing an immortal usually fears.

In mortal consideration, divine casters often pledge themselves to a specific "domain", such as the domain of [[death]], which aligns with the divine portfolios of many gods.
