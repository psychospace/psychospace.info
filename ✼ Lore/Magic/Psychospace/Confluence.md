A **confluence** or **conflux**, also known as a **[[Psychospace|psychospacial]] torrent**, is a geographical location in [[The Heavens]] where [[Psinomenon|psinomena]] are known to be traced to: either created, received, or otherwise interacting there. It is a point where two massive amounts of shifts in energy, such that they are common, can meet. 

A common type of confluence is a [[phantasm]].

In one such example, the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]] and the subsequent [[altercation]] which resulted, created confluences between [[vitality energy]] and [[void energy]] that caused [[undead]] plagues.
