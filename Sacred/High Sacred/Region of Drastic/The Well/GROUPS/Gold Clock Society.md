The **Gold Clock Society** is a large, multi-armed organization comprised of the business owners and highest elite in [[The Well]]. Each member is marked by their ownership of a distinctive gold clock which ticks a little funny.

[[Arthur Graywell]] and other detectives are not aware of the Society's existence, which rarely commits crimes, and even more rarely under its own objectives.

Members include:
-   [[Rosewire Abatah]], who once acted as the faction's ambassador.
-   [[Vergoldeter Minutenzeiger Panikdrache]], the faction's *de facto* head.
-   [[Ashton Orpheus Albatros]], also known as "Ace of Gold", who owns [[The Leprechaun's Haul]] casino where the Society holds many of their meetings. The faction's historian.
