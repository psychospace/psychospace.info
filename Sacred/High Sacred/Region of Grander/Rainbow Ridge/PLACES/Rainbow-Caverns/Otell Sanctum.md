The **Otell Sanctum** was a locale inside the [[Rainbow Caverns]] outside [[Rainbow Ridge]]. Ruled by a number of monstrous, misanthropic dark-[[Dwarf|dwarves]], the occupants lorded over machines and ruins of the [[Old world]]. Their base, enshrined in glass and steel, was marked by a sign which read "OTEL L".

In [[1250 PT]], they were infiltrated by [[Phys]] of [[Heartknock]]. Later on, [[Ikabod Caruso]] sold them "a slave" as part of leveraging their ingenuity in [[psionics]]. When this "slave" did not function or obey them, they lashed out further, eventually leading to their destruction at the hands of the [[S4]].

Phys eventually retrieved a mind mech from the Sanctum to attempt to take revenge, but this ended up failing as well, impressing [[Lazuli Dino|Linnaeus]] with the skill of the people who assisted Ikabod. Phys would never know, but this would lead to the chain of events that brought about [[Red Spark]].
