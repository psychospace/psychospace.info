**Coursing Stream** is a humanoid golem with massive wings, constructed as the controller of the defenses of [[Aet'Caldwyn]]. Its sister unit was [[Lucid Sky]].

Stream's wings are made of a glittering gold and blue [[water]] current, like the sky at sundown, as the embodiment of the [[Grand Watersea]] itself. Though originally tasked with finding a way to snuff out the [[blackflame]], when this did not work, Stream offered its strength to keep it sealed away, protecting the city with its watchful gaze and powerful body.

Through the eons, Coursing Stream had seen much more degradation than its ally, and its mental state was incapable of recognizing when the [[Invertebra]] had been rightfully taken.
