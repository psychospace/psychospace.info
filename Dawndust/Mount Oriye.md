**Mount Oriye** is a major mountain peak of [[Dawndust]], containing a massive sprawling underground beneath it. 

In its caverns were the places where the first [[gnome|gnomish]] [[Core engine|cores]] were engineered for the purposes of creating [[airship|airships]]; the [[Channel of Aktomos]] was constructed *through* the mountain, preserving their powerful ambition for modern generations. 

Per the channel's name, the ruins of [[Aktomos]], an ancient town predating the state of [[Shinedown]], were buried when the Channel was constructed.
