**Illarion Parasom** was the disgraced [[Lord of Law]] of the [[Great Nortian Empire]] from [[1214 PT]] to [[1251 PT]]. A noble of [[House Parasom]], they masterminded the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], which usurped the government and caused the [[Dragonic War]].

A [[kalashtar]], under his bumbling visage was a cold-hearted man willing to do whatever needs to be done to fulfill his desire of protecting the world from the [[End Times]]: however, his actions inadvertently might have caused it to occur.

He died in [[1251 PT]], on [[Zero Day]].

# History
Illarion Parasom was born in [[1165 PT]]. When Illarion was very young, he had a vision of the world ending, and believed it would happen inside his lifetime. 

Prior to [[1206 PT]], he had been married to [[Lyudmila Nabakov]] for some time. With her, he had a daughter named [[Amanita Parasom]], whose shadow later self-actualized into [[Octavia Parasom|Octavia]].

In [[1214 PT]], he rose to his station after the passing of his mother. The day he became Lord of Law, he learned of [[Project KC]]: that was the same day Lyudmila was killed, a grim portent of a future he now was almost assured would occur.

He later remarried, marrying Contessa [[Scarla Nitrum]].

## Creation of the Conspiracy
After Amanita's discovery in [[1245 PT]], he begain receiving visions from a mysterious presence whom he assumed was his [[quori]] or an [[angel]], but was actually the voice of [[Arizhmiya]]. He believed the voice was speaking to him from the [[elseworld]], warning him to avert the fate they had suffered already. 

This incentivized his creation of the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], something which was partly Scarla's manipulation at work. Like all of the Conspirators, Illarion normally wore the [[Cloak of Excelsio]], and Illarion was its leader in hiding.



## Death
Near to the end of the Dragonic War, Illarion lost most of the control he'd been given over the Conspiracy, as the workings of his enemies surpassed and overcame his defenses, as well as the necessity to cut losses. 

By the time of the S4's final mission to Nortia, he had essentially no authority left, and [[Wren Doggabone|Wren]] had ordered Amanita and Octavia be grounded permanently in [[Yofora]] to ensure any negotiation with him was tilted in their favor.

On [[Zero Day]], [[1251 PT]], Illarion ascended the [[Nail of Nortia]] for the last time to negotiate for Octavia's location, as she had apparently been kidnapped by Scarla (through [[XO]]). Despite being told what Scarla's true plans were, he resisted her, believing her plan of etching the [[sky-scrape]] to be far too dangerous. For his insubordination, as well as his failure in stopping the [[S4]]'s retrieval of [[Linnaeus Dino]], he was left for dead by Nemain: his eyes were cut out, and his arteries were left mostly severed. 

He managed just long enough to feign death so he could commute a last desire to the S4 to stop Scarla, and a final, pained apology to both [[Serena Nortia|Serena]] and his daughters for his foolish endeavors. There, he was put to rest by [[toll the dead]], from [[Even Baxly]].

In the end, his dying wish came true, as well as his wish to stop the end of the world.
