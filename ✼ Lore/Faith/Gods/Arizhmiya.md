**Lagacia**, the Mortal Puppeteer, also known by its current shade name **Arizhmiya**, is [[Divinity|god]] of the past.  It also oversees the domains of rejection, lies, and authority. Its manifestation is that of an almost liquid mask made of metal.

It served as the major divine antagonist of [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]]. This god's teachings are suppressed by the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], but are embraced by cults like the [[Heartknock|School of Heartknock]].

Arizhmiya is often also known under masks itself or hidden behind its own divine allies, such as the snake lord [[Eoremu]].

# History
This god came to be alongside [[Psychospace]]: a counterpart to [[Exponen]], deity of the future. When Exponen was stillborn, Lagacia was already destined to be its sworn enemy, waiting for the arrival of Exponen to the world. 

Lagacia, born to [[Cientia]] and [[Athemat]], was born as *orphaned ash*, little more than a sputtering flame. The [[Anti|God of Gods]] took pity on these beings, raising them to godhood. Cruelly, this had stolen the ability for Lagacia to perceive its own ending, a fact which inadvertently allowed Exponen to live.

# Domain
![[⎋ Needs Rewrite]]

They're about willingly and ecstatically taking on a false persona for the promise of a "better world" in absence of your true self. They uphold that discarding one's self, one's control and opinions, is a worthwhile thing that leads to growth.

One of their rites of purification is passing through a hallway without one's mask, flanked on either side by masked acolytes holding candles and mirrors to recall the true self, and in this moment, suppress it. You need not the mask to hide your face if you reject it altogether.

This god says to willingly abandon any path you can potentially take, for the sake of reducing your chances of failure. In this way, they're allied with a number of lawful deities and may appear good. However, this is because lying is not an inherently evil action: hiding the truth from someone to keep them safe or happy, or to let them down easy, is not necessarily evil. However, Arizhmiya's influence is that of rejecting the truth and justice of the world, which punishes the fools and rewards the innovators. Indeed, Arizhmiya rejects risk altogether, and that is why it is a predominantly evil god.

This god is no trickster deity, although it is indeed on the fringe of that domain. It is the absence of risk and control, not necessarily the absence of truth. In this, its teachings are anathema to the tricksters, which toys with shadows in the pursuit of sowing fear, making playthings out of risky situations. This deity would be more likely to fit into the knowledge domain, embodying discovery of a self synthesized more than a self realized.

This deity often appears benevolent or inactive, rarely betraying its true nature as an active force of deception. How can a puppet feel its strings when it can't do so willingly? The domination spells and mind control spells are its followers lot in life: to willingly puppet others, so that they can willingly act under you. It is all a means of control, whether conscious or unconscious.

Some of those who rejected the teachings of Arizhmiya are found later having committed suicide by blunt force. Essentially, they punch themselves in the side of the head until they break through and smash their skull, destroying themselves.
