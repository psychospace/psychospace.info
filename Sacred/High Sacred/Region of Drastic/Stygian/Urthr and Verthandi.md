**Urthr** and **Verthandi** are interrelated [[Evangel|evangels]] who were hidden away within the [[Vault of Foreknowledge]], ordained to form a renewed dynasty of [[Carapa Republic|Carapa]]. There was a third, **Skuld**, but they absconded from the remnant before they could be hidden away. Later, they were known as [[Certain (evangel)|Certain]].

Urthr, Verthandi, and Skuld were sisters, each of whom were daughters of the last lord of Carapa, [[Aso ar'Carapa]].
