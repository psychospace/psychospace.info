**Sorcery** is a [[Magic|magical]] study of the innate natural properties of the [[soul]], especially by awakening powers or [[Soul bond|soul bonds]], termed "sources", divested into one's heritage or lineage through the [[fylgja]]. A **sorcerer** or **sorceress** is a student of sorcery.

Similar to [[Wizardry|wizardry]], sorcery can awaken in the body through study. 

# Description
Sorcerers understand more than most the pervasive nature of [[psychospace]], and can harness its persistent [[psinomenon|psinomena]] to tap into their own [[Body|bodies]]. Sorcerers can often astound even themselves through nurturing their connection to power, regardless if they know the exact source of those connections. 

By utilizing what are sometimes called "source-points", sorcerers may slightly amplify or breach existing [[tribute]] conventions, a process they call **metamagic**. These "source-points" are akin to the concept of [[ki]], and are similarly regained with the health of one's own body.

A myriad of studies of sorcery exist, each focused on particular "sources", including [[wild magic]], [[soulstone|soulstones]], [[Echo|shadow]], [[fey|fey-blood]], and [[Dragon|dragon-blood]]. In one sense, the all-encompassing spiritual nature of these influences leaves imprints across vast portions of the [[The Planet|Planet]], and so become commonplace for powerful magic to be fostered.

# History

For most of known history, sorcery was an ill-understood topic, with only specific instances gaining notice as isolated mythologies, such as the Champions of [[Barbiche]]. Mostly, sorcerers offered their assistance to various governments as "court sorcerers", whose power as a singleton caster benefitted the difficulties of trust in a royal environment. Following the advent of the [[Age of Adventurers]], more and more academic work has been focused on understanding the exact differences between it and other studies of magic.
