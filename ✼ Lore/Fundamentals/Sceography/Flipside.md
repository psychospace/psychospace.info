A **flipside** is the other side, physically, of a [[Remnant]].

By normal [[Gravity]], a denizen of one side cannot reach the other side. Certain places on each remnant act as “areas of crossing”, where one can travel to the “opposite side of the coin”: the opposite side of the remnant. These places of crossing, called [[Phantasm|phantasms]], are more prevalent in [[Psychospace]], but can often exist materially under the right conditions.

For example, the flipside of [[Bullion]] is [[Tarnation]].

The alternate planes of existence reached in this manner are technically places on the [[Wild Blue Yonder]]. Not all "planes" are a single remnant's counterpart; as another point, not all remnants have distinct planes attached to them.
