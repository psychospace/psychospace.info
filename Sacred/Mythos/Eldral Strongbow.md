Eldral Strongbow was a legendary hero who was prominent some time before the time of [[Critical Hit]], during the [[War of the Masters]]. As a brave general, with the secret help of Nortian surveillance ships, he led a successful campaign against [[Bullion]]. As an older man, he would pen short novels of his adventures and spread them to the masses.

He uses a greatbow, hence his name.
