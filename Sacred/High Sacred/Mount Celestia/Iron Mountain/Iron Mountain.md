The central city of the sacred lands of [[Mount Celestia]] is known as **Iron Mountain**. In [[Celestial]], the town is simply known as "Celestia City". It functions as the birth place and holy site of many celestials. Mortal champions of the gods, the most devoted clerics, and the truly exalted people of the world come to reside here in its highest district, the Lock Ward.

As the name suggests, Iron Mountain is a town in and around the eponymous mountain which gives the [[Flipside]] its name.

The city is represented partially in [[Kingdom of Sacred]] by its ambassador, a cloaked woman partially constructed of light known as [[Couth Lovibond]].
