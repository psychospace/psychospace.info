The **Tower of Electron** is a massive technological wonder in [[Drastic]], which acts as the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]'s main mail office, and its magical mail courier, as well as a place of research on the bleeding edge of arcane discovery.

It is named for and overseen by **Electron,** a massive automaton encased in a Dyson sphere of sorts at the top of the tower, and was constructed in pieces over the journeys of the Sacrosanct Squadron "[[Critical Hit]]". 

This tower helps to defend the city (through Electron's raw strength and the Tower's scholar's technology), and is also used to facilitate special long-distance mail delivery through the [[Duplicrow|duplicrows]] and other efforts of the Royal Volary. In certain conditions, it is capable of controlling the [[Weather]], for example for official occasions.

**[[Hieron Dredge]]** works here as a keeper, under the employ of **Postmaestro [[Succotash]]**.
