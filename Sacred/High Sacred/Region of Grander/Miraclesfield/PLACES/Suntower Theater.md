Base of the [[Bad Daisies]].

The facade is an old wood and bronze opera house with a brilliant topaz-colored marquee reading “THE SUNFLOWER THEATER”, the F having been inverted over the years overlaid with the L to read SUNtOWER. The top of the marquee has been transformed over time into a makeshift bed of roses, dandelions, and buttercups. Through the cracks in the tough-but-aging wood, one can see vines curling through.

The back area was once a garden of the noble owner’s manor, used for garden parties and the like, which has been converted into a kind of odeon and dueling yard. Meanwhile, the indoor theater space has gradually shifted into a base of operations for the tenants.
