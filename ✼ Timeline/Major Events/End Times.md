The **End Times** are a theoretical [[Time|future]]^[Potentially present, depending on some interpretations.] apocalyptic era of [[the Heavens]], which are referenced in several mythologies from across the skyseas.

Though unknown what exactly would transpire, it would culminate in an inevitable [[collapse state]], the utter [[TPK|vanishing]] of [[psychospace]], and the likely death of all life, mortal or [[immortal]]. It is unknown the timescale of or moment that such an event might ever happen.

Considering that there exists the belief that the world [[War of Chaos|already ended]] once before, the End Times may be some form of a potential cyclical state of existence for the planet. Within the mythology of the [[Pantheon of Dawndust]], it is said that the End Times would begin with a "clash between [[Arizhmiya|past]] and [[Exponen|future]]", when all time would begin to collapse into some form of [singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_singularity).

Existential fear of this magnitude, and rediscovery of the [[elseworld]] which had in-part experienced this, led [[Illarion Parasom]] to conduct [[Nortian Conspiracy|his conspiracy]].
