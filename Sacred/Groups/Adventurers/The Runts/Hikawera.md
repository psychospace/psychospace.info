**Hikawera** (*hee-kah-wear-ah*) is a nonbinary warrior [[Elf#Sea elves|triton]] from the outer islands of [[Pinwheel]], presently a [[Witchcraft|witch]] of an entity known as the World Machine. Their home island is known as [[Karma Rock]].

They are the leader of [[The Runts]], an adventuring party allied with the [[S4]].

Hikawera wears a magically [[Curse|cursed]] ring bearing the mark of [[Renthe]] ([[Ring of Renthe]]), god of mechanisms and patron deity of Giia. By touching any non-living object of a Medium or smaller size with the hand that bears that ring, it turns into some kind of weapon in mere moments, infused rapidly with gears and other seemingly random mechanical parts.

# History

A forge cleric who took well to electro-magical engineering, their teacher and idol, the legendary [[Ortensia Howards]] from [[Yofora]], suddenly one day vanished off the face of Karma Rock, leaving Hikawera high and dry.

Months later, Hikawera received a mysterious letter in the mail bearing Ortensia's seal containing a winged key to an airship, *[[The Mimi]]*, kept in dock, along with a ring. It seemed that the young warrior had been bequeathed the airship and ring for their servitude to the Lord of [[Giia]]. Servitude that had never occurred. In fact, Ortensia was the one bequeathed. Why send their spoils to a pupil they had essentially abandoned?

In truth, Hikawera couldn't believe their luck. Not only had they entirely dodged the conscription into the Pinwheeler Military, they had come out on top. Ortensia had fallen under their spell, and had followed their orders to the letter. The magical voice in their head was right. It went according to a perfect, improbable plan. That voice was from an entity of luck and infinite chance. They were who they said they were. They were the World Machine — [[Quals]].

It is for this reason that Hikawera is both a forge cleric and an [[Out There|Old One]] warlock.
