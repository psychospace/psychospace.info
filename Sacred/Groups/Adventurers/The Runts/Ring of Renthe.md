The **ring of Renthe**, also called **the First Machine** or simply **the Machine**, is a [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin]] originally found in [[Väräh]]. Its present and modern iteration is a special silvery ring which bears a obsidian-inlaid signet appearing in the shape of a chain. 

The ring is possessed by [[Hikawera]], and is a product of Renthe's battles with [[Quals]], Hika's patron.

# Effects
It contains what is supposedly a fragment of the "[[Soul|soul]]" of [[Renthe]], god of machines, as corrupted in its many battles with entities which defile the [[Logic|logic]] of [[Psychospace|psychospace]]. However, it is also [[Curse|cursed]], so anyone whose hand graces the ring cannot remove it without removing the finger that bears it. 

When worn without a glove or gauntlet, the ring mechanizes anything and everything the user touches, transforming them subconsciously into weaponry. Of note is that even if wielded by another character, any creation of the Machine cannot hurt its attuner at all, and will break before they do. 

# History
Many similar artifacts have existed, used by Renthe as a manner of cleansing itself of impurities. Around 22 of these objects are known to exist, and most are believed to be locked away below [[Pinwheel]] in the endless vaults of [[Giia]]. One is in the possession of the [[Fifth Institute]] as [[Perícopa Doce]] DisC. 136.

>>[!info]- D&D 5e
>>*Wondrous item, artifact, requires attunement*
>>
>>This ring is [[Curse|cursed]] and cannot be removed without removing the finger that bears it. The ring appears incorporeal to gloves, always appearing on the outermost layer of clothing, and can't be touched by anything or who anyone isn't attuned to the ring, appearing to be passed right through. Wearing a glove or gauntlet mutes the ring's effects, but it longs to be used, and will weigh heavily on the user. Anything which doesn't have a soul cannot attune to the ring.
>>
>>If the finger is removed, the ring can be touched and removed. If it isn't worn within a day after being removed, the ring suddenly vanishes and reappears elsewhere in the world, seeking a bearer. 
>>
>>When the hand bearing the Machine touches a non-living Medium or smaller solid object not being worn or carried, the Machine transforms that object into a machined weapon or piece of ammunition in a matter of seconds. It needn't be the same size as the original object, and this can lead to dramatic shifts in combat state in mere moments. This weapon can take any form, and the object grows gears, chains, axles, and other machine pieces as long as the bearer holds it in order to become a weapon. The form of the weapon is determined by the DM, and any weapon created is considered to deal magical damage for the purposes of circumventing non-magic damage immunities.
>>
>>Each use of the Machine causes the user to feel a chill down their spine, which can feel euphoric on occasion. While transforming an object, the object tries its best to remove itself from anything it's touching or connected to to slip into the hands of the wielder of the Machine. If the object can't for whatever reason, it never starts transforming. However, when successful, this moment is enough to give the [[illusion]] that its wielder has super strength.
>>
>>A complex weapon not listed on the Weapons list can be created by the Machine, but usually only is generated in its wielder's hour of need. These include cannons, turrets, and ballistae.
>>
>>Such weapons still have the material form of the object they were comprised of, meaning a glass weapon will still shatter easily, a wooden one can still be set afire, and a metal one is still incredibly heavy. A weapon which breaks itself into disrepair stops functioning immediately, stops being a weapon, and each of the mechanical pieces that make it up turn to dust, although the Machine will immediately try transforming the fragment still in its user's grasp.
>>
>>When the bearer drops such an item, it doesn't immediately stop being an item. The user can decide to either destroy the object or maintain it. If the user chooses to destroy the object, through the next 3 minutes, the mechanical pieces turn to rust and then to dust, and the object breaks. If the user decides to maintain it, the object will hold its form and could even be used by other creatures. The user can decide to destroy a maintained object at any time (no action required) in the manner stated above, and the user can maintain an unknown number of these objects. If the user can't decide, because they fell unconscious or were forced to drop their weapon magically, the default choice is to destroy it.
>>
>>All magical objects aren't affected by the Machine, and neither are any objects that the wielder is standing on.
