**Witchcraft** is a [[Magic|magical]] study, focused on the body's connections to external forces, viewing the world as an interlinked web of influences. Witchcraft is often called the fundaments of [[reality-bending]], a process the craft calls *reckoning*.

**Witches**, also known as **warlocks**, are the users of witchcraft. Traditionally female and traditionally demonized^[Due to the [[Coven of the Night#Reputation|reputation]] of the [[Coven of the Night]]], witches are widely mythologized, and any person can find themselves toiling in witchcraft.

Witches are among the most ancient [[magic]]-casters whose work survives today, perhaps because it is so base to reality. Despite this, its regular use of reality-alteration has caused it to fall under the moniker of [[new magic]], as its use becomes more proliferated.

# Institutions
Due to the unpredictable nature of patron forces, most academic study of witchcraft relies on control, or efforts like [[antimagic|antimagically]] suppressing the influence of these forces.

 A group of witches or warlocks is known as a **coven**. Some of the more commonly known institutions who support the free practice of witchcraft include large, multi-remnantal covens, such as the [[Coven of the Night]].

[[Thaumaturgy|Thaumaturges]] of the modern era often find their work coinciding with much of the study of witchcraft, as both focus in on esoterica.

 Officially, witchcraft is partly a clade of new-magic.
