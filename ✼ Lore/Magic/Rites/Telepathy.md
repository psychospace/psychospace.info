**Telepathy**, sometimes called **thoughtspeech**, is the [[Magic|magical]], [[Psion|psychic]] ability to share and receive thoughts, sensations, and emotions willfully, from a source outside your own [[Viewpoint property|viewpoint]]. A user of telepathy is known as a **telepath**. In its multiple facets, telepathy is one of a number of abilities which "interpret" [[psychospace]].

According to research, the ability is at the bedrock of powerful [[soul bond|soul bonds]], indicative of two things: that [[Soul|souls]] yearn to reach out to one another, and that psychospace is a medium by which souls these souls may yearn. Telepathy can be both a curse and a blessing, as not all souls are well-suited to receive so much information at once.

[[Uforia]] possessed the strongest telepathy ever known, able to do it over a large distance and across multiple thousands of hosts (as in the national legends of [[Valerian]]): this was eventually distilled into her descendants as the ability of [[monism]].

# Facets

There are several, individual facets of telepathy. An individual telepath may be capable of one facet without being capable of another.

Similar to [[Portal|teleportation]], a telepath needs a "conduit", "destination", and "source", each of which contribute to its particular manifestation's [[tribute]]. Though traditionally occuring through the medium of the [[air]], some manifestations of telepathy have different [[Phoreus field|phoreuses]] and thus different transfer methods, ranges and complexities of messaging possible.

Temporary bonds can be forged which create powerful "mental networks" between specific people. The spell *[[sending]]* and its lesser form *message*, as well as items like *sending stones* and [[EMCD|talkstones]], allow someone to possess a temporary form of this ability.

## Contact
**Chiropathy** or **contact telepathy** is the ability to communicate through the mind when in contact with another's [[body]]. Often paired with [[Curse|curses]], chiropathy can drastically change the way someone communicates.

## Dream
**Oneiropathy**, more commonly **dream telepathy**, is the ability to communicate across space using [[dream|dreams]]. 

## "Perfect"

"**Perfect**" telepathy, sometimes called **divine telepathy**, is the telepathic ability to access and implant thoughts *ad hoc* across an abnormal distance. It is an extremely rare ability, often combined with mind control and other immense abilities.

In [[Syncretism|syncretism]], it is sometimes said that [[Succession (ability)|Succession]] is a kind of biological form of perfect telepathy, able to transfer all knowledge upon death.
