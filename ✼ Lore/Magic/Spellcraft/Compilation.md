**Compilation**, or **codification**, is the [[Magic|magical]] process of turning raw [[Psychic code|psychic code]] into a [[Spell|Spell]], interpreting a desired result into an effect that originates from your [[Soul|Soul]]. As a science, compilation is both the invention of new spells and the personal recreation of existing spells.

Compilation is a necessary step of creating most any spell, divine or arcane, under the [[New Magic|old definition]]. It allows a caster to safely experiment with the effect without creating significant, dangerous variance. Another goal of codifying spells is to find a material which naturally provides the most efficient [[Tribute|Tribute]] for the desired effect.

However, codification of spells is rendered more difficult by the [[Viewpoint property|viewpoint property]].

Codified spells are that which are taught in arcane schools, significantly proven safe, or shared with members of a clergy or faith. In the latter case, spells might take the form of stories which themselves contain the powers they describe.
