The shining capital city of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], **Drastic**, is scarred by a number of wars which have once graced it. It stands at a water port in just about the center of [[High Sacred]]. Many tall buildings mark its proud skyline.

Although also the center of a duchy, it no longer has a duke as of its last duke, [[Tyranno Re Ursus]], ascending to the station of king-consort. Drastic and [[The Well]], its sister city, are inhabited by about 280,000 individuals.

Its eidolon used to be [[Ildy]], but after the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]], was left without one for sometime. Previously known as the Holy Port of Ace.
