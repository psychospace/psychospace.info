A uniquely despicable thing, the **cloak of the skeptic** is a mantle created by a mischievous [[Fey|fey]] who disrupted a religious community by spreading falsehoods. When the fey was attacked back, the faith he had stolen from the townspeople protected him, acting as a shield. It is currently in the possession of [[Even Baxly]].

>>While attuned, each time you restore hit points to any creature that restores them to full, they gain temporary hit points equal to the number of hit points they could have healed over the maximum. Spells which do not function on undead (such as most healing spells) ignore that restriction when you cast them.
>> 
>> Once per round, if you take damage which would reduce your temporary hit points to 0, you can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to negate taking damage to your non-temporary hit points. You regain the ability to do this at the end of your next turn.
