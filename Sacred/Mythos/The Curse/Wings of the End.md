The **Wings of the End** (Крылья Конца) was a companion greatsword to Queen [[Velocis Dino|Velocis]]. It was a sentient greatsword pulled from an island in the [[Colossal Ocean]] along with many [[Wraithsword|wraithswords]] of its kind retrieved during the [[War of the Masters]]. 

In particular, this sword was recovered by [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] soldiers of the Army of Euphony, and later gifted to Sacred as proof of Nortia's role in the war. Its removal sparked the destruction of the small island it was embedded in: proof, certainly, of its incredible power.

It hovered on its own and attended Queen Velocis as an ally bound to her. It harbors goals of seeing the perpetuation of its power throughout the ages, but often enjoys the simpler things in life, such as tea and secretarial duties. The soul that inhabits it was once an old noble on the island which inhabited it, but this identity has eroded over the aeons.

The sword gave its subjectivity up in order to become vessel to the [[Blackflame]] in [[1251 PT]], in hopes that the prince [[Linnaeus Dino]] would no longer suffer. The *[[Wings of Dawn]]* was named in honor of its sacrifice.
