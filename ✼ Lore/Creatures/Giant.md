>[!question|bg-c-blue ttl-c] Not to be confused with "half-giants" in [[anlage]].

**Giants** are varied powerful, ancient, and physically-imposing humanoid creatures who are ensorcelled by [[Echo|echoes]]. Their bodies are complex ecosystems which have long captured the imaginations and curiosities of the world, offering homes for myriad life. Among their species, including [[Elemental creatures|elemental]] types, giants are variously described as holders of [[The Planet|Yalagnu]]'s secrets, gaining power from mythological prowess. 

Primeval giants have long been held to be some of the original inheritors of [[the Planet]]: in some views, they are the mortal children of [[Anti|Antic]] flesh, made to shake and shape the earth as their creator did. They existed before and alongside the works of [[First Magicians]]; it is well-known that essentially every natural remnant was at one point home to a giant society of some form or another, and the works they left behind, as well as modern pockets of giant occupation, can still be found today.

A group of giants is known as a **clod**, and a young giant is known as a "**pebble**" or "**pearl**", depending on its point of origin.

# History
![[⎋ Uncommon#^1bfe2a]]
It is believed that though giants today are massive, when they first came into existence they were even larger, dwarfing most remnants. Some believe that they were the first creatures to be borne of echoes, prior to the existence of the cycle of souls. **Supergiants**, as they are called today, were mortal servitors of the original [[◍ The World Born in Stone|world born in stone]]. 

According to [[Cientia|Cientian]] mythos, during the twilight years of the [[Unknown Era]], their bodies was said to be the unshaped [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]], in the form of land, cloud, sea, and heat, sculpted into flesh by the light of [[Cien]]. Supergiants, carrying in their bodies an immense amount of echoes, regularly came into conflict with one another over the course of their existence. The bloodiest of their conflicts severed them into many [[skysea|skyseas]] and [[Remnant|remnants]], and the most destructive battle between supergiants created the region known today as the [[Colossal Ocean]].

Eventually, though, supergiants brought about their own extinction through such conflicts, at least partly influenced by the [[Dragon#Zhill|zhill]] and the novel invention of [[psychospace]]. Modern giants are the byproduct of this venture, as the blood of supergiants coursing through remnants was a conditional [primordial soup](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_soup) that laid the basis for echoes to [[Gravity|gravitate]] together and form [[Soul|souls]] contained inside [[Body|bodies]].

This blood eventually led to megaflora and megafauna emerging as early mortal life (as is seen today in the [[Giant Forest]]), eventually supplanted (for efficiency's sake) by those of a size much more typical of today.

# Culture

Broadly-speaking, giant culture is largely inscrutable to the modern mortal eye. Like the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] that learned from them, giants view their bodies not just as parts of themselves, but as necessary parts of the environment, to be improved and then repurposed upon their demise. As an element of this paradigm, giants believe that society, like life itself, progresses and regresses as part of a natural cycle, though the exact shape of this gradual transformation changes based on the type of giant[^1].

Though their lifespans have never been seen to end naturally, giants do go through a cycle of maturity, which can end when confronted by normal threats to life and person. They craft and use tools for regular activity, with some constructing keeps and forges, though mostly in the name of survival or contemplation first-and-foremost. 

Giants widely worship an icon broadly identified as the [[Cientia|Titan of Time]], though due to fear. A giant has rare need to fear the passage of time, but in time, all things cycle anew, and the old is rendered unrecognizable: perhaps due to their original purpose in their creation, the passing of the torch is something of an anxiety looming over giant psychology

Through impressive [[senzai]] even for the most simple-minded giants, they are capable, to some degree not widely studied, of natural [[divination]], able to know when their time is come. This has allowed them to make works of art associating their future with that of generations beyond, and this is where their fascination with [[rune|runes]] began, as they commute the truth of the [[Divine Equation]] as they see it.

Each giant borne of a particular generation is by default assumed to be equal to its peers. As such, giants with a lack of achievement are not typically given names, and many form a [[soul bond|bond]]-based [[Telepathy|telepathic]] connection with one another. Due to echoes' association with resonance, the connection between equivocated giants has often manifested in the form of a musical kinship, such as through war-horns conveying orders to entire clods at a time.

Despite their myriad distinctions, different types of giant see each other as different castes of the same greater-whole, though their broad lack of wisdom leaves them vulnerable to subterfuge.

## Cohabitation

The intercession of [[scion]] and then traditional mortal life has placed boundaries (both literal and metaphorical) on giant expansionism, which giants typically respect unless to feed or when threatened. The rare giant-sapient communities largely form because an incursion by the latter was seen as a necessary evil in order to maintain a piece in the systems of life, such as in the case of [[Cherryheart]], where giants help to maintain the [[Father Sakura]].

In their time, giants were the ever-present antagonists of [[Dragon|dragons]], hunting them for food and materials mercilessly. Eventually, they enslaved colonies of dragons in order to become the first non-skyborne creatures to travel across the remnants. Today, giants and dragons remain extremely animose to one another, something that can even be felt in the blood of their descendants, as [[Kobold|kobolds]] and [[anlage]] often despise one another.

 Their association with and berserking of dragons caused them to occasionally slay [[eidolon|eidolons]], and is why giant-sapient communities typically fail to form the necessary conditions for one to [[Eidolon#Appearance|appear]]. However, clod-borne eidolons, rare though they are, are typically seen as members of their system of nature.

# Views
Giants were prevalent throughout much of early life on the Planet and thus recur in legends across the many seas.

Though characterized in myths as brutish and barbaric, giants have been consistently threatened by the incursion of other species. Giants are thwarted by many weapons sapient life has created, including arrows, spears, [[firearm|firearms]], and (most prevalent in their near-extinction) [[magic]], which giants have proven incapable of mastering outside of more [[reality-bending|direct means]].

A rampaging giant, even despite all the advances in mortal life, still has the potential to cause massive havoc in a surrounding community, as defenses crumble under their size and ability to predict oncoming attacks or dangers to their clod. A giant's omnivorous appetite is universally accepting, and they eat what they please without much recourse in almost all scenarios. Ambitious giants may even form their own ecological niche out of thieving farmland animals and crops, as underprepared communities serve as good hunting grounds.

It is for these threats and reasons that many of the [[Age of Adventurers]] grow up with giant-hating ambitions of their own.
