The **Manifold Seas**, sometimes also called **manifold space** and known to [[Chaos]] derisively as the **Structure**, are the interconnected [[Plane#Realm|realms]] of the [[universe]], created by the light of [[star|stars]], adrift in [[Out There|outer space]], and accreted by [[Gravity|gravity]]. The term is differentiated from the state of shapeless creation, the [[Chartless Sea]].

The term is essentially synonymous with the "physical world".

Individual seas of manifold space are created by the light of [[Star|stars]] and the influence of [[Plane#Pyrean|pyrean planes]]; for one example, the [[Antic Sea]] is manifold in nature.

The state of existence derives its name from passages of the [[Apocrypha of Winds]].
