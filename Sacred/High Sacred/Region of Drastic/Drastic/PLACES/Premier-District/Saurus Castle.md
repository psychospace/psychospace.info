**Saurus Castle** is the holy castle and central fort and abode of [[House Dino]], the grandest and most elegant building in all of [[Drastic]]. Truly a magnificent sight with 5 peaked towers and a keep surrounding it. [[Filistec|Filistecs]] are mounted on the castle walls to lance bolts of divine energy at enemies of Drastic. Protected by a massive enchantment and energy field crafted by [[Boldin Iron-Heart]], very few things can get in or out of its gates without clearance.

The castle was originally constructed during the time of the Twindragons, replacing older fortifications that were destroyed during the Night of Fate during Drastic's second transformation.

The [[Sanctum Most Sacred]] exists within a temple on the grounds of Saurus Castle. The Kingtower is the second-highest room in [[Saurus Castle]], and acts as a sort of "apartment" from which the king and queen oversee their domain.
