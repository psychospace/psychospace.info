The **Blood War** was an ancient conflict waged between [[Demon|demons]] and [[devil|devils]] over control of the [[Scarlet Skies]]. It began during the [[Age of the Gods]], and like many significant divine events, originated out of two deities pitting their opposed domains against one another. Its wake swept across the [[Wild Blue Yonder]] with abandon for millennia, as neither combatant sought to bring everlasting death to either their own Hells, nor [[Unwri]]'s bridge to [[Welkin]]. 

With no determined victor, the conflict was brought to an unsteady armistice by the [[Angel|angels]] following the events of [[The Gathering|the Gathering]]. This was when the gods [[Pothesis]] and [[Roced]] both agreed to be stewards of [[Death|Death]], under [[Exponen|Nexos]] and the [[Avatar of Death]], with the goals of not allowing further alterations to psychospace's basic components.
