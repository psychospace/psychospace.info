**Adinah Ilacqua** is a member of the [[Windriders]]. 

She is originally from the lands known as [[Scarred Sacred]], where she spent her childhood. She became a traveling merchant specializing in exotic goods. She traveled Sacred for years, trading in a variety of interesting items before landing in [[Osprey Bay]]. She met [[Isadora Ilacqua|Isadora]] and the two fell in love, dating for some time before being wed five years ago. 

She now resides in Osprey Bay but makes occasional trips around Sacred to collect rare goods to sell and visit contacts. She has a small team of 3 to go collect goods and information for her and often hires adventurers to do the same. She is kind, but shrewd, and has a loud, infectious laugh.

She smiles a lot and may look carefree but has a strong work ethic and focusing ability. She has a large scar on her neck but she when asked about it, she dances around the question. Gets along well with the Levin family, but minor disagreements show up sometimes. The most recent fight was about Adinah wanting to sell some of her wares at the restaurant. Has a trusted horse named Windrider who she cares for greatly.

Regarding that scar, when she was a young girl she accidentally took an axe to the throat from her father. Although she survived with the help of her town's medics and healers, the wound itself bled her out, so that scar is technically proof that she has returned from the dead. Naturally, accident or not, the event itself led to her falling out with her father and seeking her own path.

Adinah is 32.
