**Catclaw**, briefly known as the **visitant dagger**, is a [[Psionics|psychic]] [[Antique|artifact]] sword wielded by the [[S4]], forged by [[Lethal]].

Following the events of [[‚çü Magical Mystery Tour]], it became [[Serratura Neeman]]'s core weapon.

# History
During the [[Dragonic War]], Lethal had become a proficient soulknife throughout his journey with the [[S4]], but the discovery of the other [[visitant|visitants]], and the growing belief that he had forged a familial bond with them, had granted him some pause on whether or not to join the party on their dangerous mission to [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]]. 

During the aerial battle aboard the [[Red Diamond]] against the *[[Briarey]]*, Lethal channeled his psionic power and created a psychic blade which, surprisingly, did not vanish when it left his hand. Always sourcing his strength from the perception that someone, ever distantly, was cheering for him, that power granted the fluke which perpetuated that dagger, at seemingly no cost to himself.

When time came for goodbyes, and seeking to participate in the mission any way he felt necessary, Lethal tied his headband around it, and gifted the ethereal dagger to Serra, hoping that the prayers of the visitants would be enough to assist the party in their final battle through their collective [[soul bond]].

When the [[echo]] of [[Ildy]] inside of [[Lazuli Dino]]'s mindscape was awakened during the battle against [[Arahabaki]], it found itself drawn to the dagger, causing it to sharpen and lengthen to become a shortsword. Ildy's dying wish was to protect the prince, and so the prayers to protect it channeled themselves into the church inside that dreamscape.  ^ff8b48

Able to hear the visitants and harness the memories they had been architected from, the prince was at last able to recall his true self, holding Arahabaki at the tip of the unnamed blade so that [[Even Baxly]] could cure him.  ^7e1c5d

Once the blade had been reinforced in this way, it became a sword which resembled the heirloom blade [[Dinofang]], and so Serratura anointed it similarly.
