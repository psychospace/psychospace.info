![[âŽ‹ Needs Rewrite]]
**Dawndust**, or **Shindan**, is a religious [[remnant]] operated primarily under an old church who once worshipped idols of light who revered healing magic, not dissimilar to the original, [[Celestial|celestial]]-based societies of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]]. 

Dawndust harbors close many secrets of the connections between gods, the remnants, and the world before all of this.

Its demonym is simply **Dawndust**, or **Shindani**.

# History

Its primary society was known as **Shinedown**, and over time the 'chief god' at the head of this religious assembly, along with the society's name, shifted to meet the needs and ideologies of the era, although a number of messy revolts pockmark the country's history.

The **[[War of the Masters]]** began when they challenged the sovereignty of a number of native [[Colossal Ocean]] societies, and probed an investigation into their history and what kind of ancient mysteries they were withholding from the outside world. Dawndust was ruled over at that time (as far as most are concerned) under Supreme Pontiff [[Eis Meticast Andar-in]], who is convinced that this war was their holy right to knowledge and to unifying all lands under their faith.

After the war was ended in [[1216 PT]], Dawndust's old government began to collapse under the debt of the war, requiring the people to save it: ironic, as these were the same people who had donated to the church during the war. With that, a revolution broke out on the remnant, and the oppressive old was replaced by a state now named **[[Novo Shindan]]**, which has been based more on traditions and religious texts from ages past: effectively a revival movement.
