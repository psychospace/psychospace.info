*If you were looking for the physical space pervaded by [[Psychospace]], see [[The Heavens]].*

The **Planet** (Oa'Rovi: ***Yalagnu***^[Yal-Ashnu]), is the common name of the physical [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet) where [[The Heavens|the Heavens]] exist and [[Psychospace]] can be channeled. It was architected from the [[Old world|old world]] by the [[Anti|god of gods]][^1]. It is a planet in the [[Antic Sea]].

Her outer atmosphere is known as the [[Dark Sea]], and her most solid surface is known as [[the Below]].

It is unknown if the Planet is the only world where psychospace exists.

With the ability to support life, and the third-nearest planet to the star [[Cien]], the Planet is a diverse rocky world with two moons, [[Lex]] and [[Ordo]]. 

# Planar stack
The Planet is comprised of what is known as the **planar stack**, a material, physical stratification of [[Chaos]]. As layers of [[Skysea|sky oceans]], containing [[Remnant|remnants]], descend towards the surface of [[gravity]], and change properties, the [[Plane#Realm|realms]] are differentiated.
