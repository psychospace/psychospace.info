The **primal curse**, also known (when concerning werewolves) as the **curse of lycanthropy**, is a [[curse]] spread through the blood, transmitted via bite, which turns those afflicted into animal-person hybrids known as **were-creatures**. It is associated with [[Void energy|negative energy]]. ^3b501c

It supposedly originated with some trick of the [[Divinity|gods]]. The curse affects each host slightly differently, and many things can be passed along with the curse due to its invasive and painful method of transmission. If you are born to a parent with the curse, you are likely to be born a [[Beastkin]].

# Weird-creatures
A **weird-creature** is what occurs when a powerful caster's spirit form is altered by their contact with the primal curse.
