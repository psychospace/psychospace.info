***Modify memory*** is a [[spell]] of moderate [[arcane complexity|complexity]].

The aim of this spell is as its name suggests: to alter the [[Echo|memories]] of a [[Creature]]. At its most basic, the caster can alter memories for around 5 minutes, after which the spell terminates. These alterations can be many: removing a memory, enhancing the recall of a memory, altering a memory's contents, or adding false memories.

At its most potent, a spell can suppress all memory of a specific topic. This has been used time and again to protect national secrets, such as the [[Dragonic Curse]], from leaking out. There is almost nothing which can correct a memory altered in this way.

This spell is considered [[Magic#Gray magic|gray]], as the ability to somewhat easily gaslight and alter cognition is dangerous when used irresponsibly.
