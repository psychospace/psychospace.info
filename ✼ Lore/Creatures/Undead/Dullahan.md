**Dullahans** are those of a certain type of [[Undead]], physically distinguished by their lack of a neck. They are a form of revenant, eternally returning until its duty is done, but in this case its duty relates to more positive emotions, like love, affection, victory, patriotism, etc. They are the culmination of much of modern [[Necromancy]] and [[Transmutation]] magics.

# Creation
A dullahan is usually manually created through twisting of specific souls and administration of specific [[Curse|curses]]: by unbinding the natural destiny that is death and tying the destiny to something else. When this is the case, a dullahan is marked by its most trademark feature: a head, bereft a neck, floating slightly above a neckhole where blood constantly oozes. 

If created abnormally, such as through a powerful regret (as in [[Red Sally]]'s case) the head will possess only its maintained connection to the body, and not float.

To craft a dullahan is to invigorate a seed of revenge or of unequal emotions within it. It is no mistake then that the [[plague of petals]], borne of unrequited love as well, is said to be closely tied to the existence of dullahans.

# Properties
Their regenerative properties are constantly at work, and it is said that a dullahan knows where all of its cells are at any one moment, even dead pieces of itself. In the case of those created by [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]], its bones are fused with [[dragon]]-blood to form a unique, hard-as-steel compound known as [[silixium]], preventing its bones from coming to pieces.
