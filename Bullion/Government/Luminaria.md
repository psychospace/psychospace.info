The Lord of the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]] is granted the title of **Luminaria**. Almost all of them are formally renamed in honor of [[Ithuriel Rysae|Ithuriel]] upon ascension to the title, and the heir-apparent is allowed to make use of the "Ith" prefix.

The Luminaria is not an inherited role, though many mistake it for this. Each is given a Crown, granted right to sit upon the [[Throne of Mana]] as well as access to a royal set of armor. One piece of this set is the [[Maedil Regalia]].

Ithuriel was said to be a "*luminaria*" by the explorers who joined them.
