A **monitor** is a broad term which refers to [[Immortal|immortals]] that field a more neutral gamut of responsibilities than [[Celestial|celestials]] or [[fiend|fiends]].

Primarily, they are the "monitors" of rules, laws, and transitions, be they the various thresholds between the [[Plane|planes]] or the more metaphorical thresholds crossed during processes like invention, [[Dream|dreams]], [[time]], or [[Death|death]]. 

It would appear that monitors are a broader concept than just the [[Antic Sea]], and some theorize they may be the go-betweens of the [[Kibangan|firmament]] and other [[manifold seas]].

They are poorly understood, as they rarely leave their home planes unless some serious event has occurred. The only monitor most are aware of are [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]], who oversee the flow of dead souls. However, well-known to those with powerful ties to [[Elemental creatures|elemental]] blood are also the [[protean|proteans]] of [[Chartless Sea]]. 

Some style themselves also as **aeons**, who protect and observe reality's conflicting aspects, or [[Harmon|Harmoni]], who help refine concepts important to reality.
# Scions
In accordance with their broader responsibilities, monitor [[Scion|scions]] are also wildly unique to one another, though much rarer than non-monitor scions. 

Sapient monitor scions include [[duskwalker|duskwalkers]], [[ganzi|ganzis]], and [[aphorite|aphorites]].
