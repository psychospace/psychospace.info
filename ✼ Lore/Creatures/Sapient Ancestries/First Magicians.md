The **First Magicians**, also known as the **First Ones**, were a #sapient race of unknown makeup or ancestry, who had access to or channels with the [[Divinity|divines]]. Initially emerging in BPT 550,000, the First Ones are likely to also be partially made up by [[Dragon|dragons]]. It is widely believed that they were the first to define [[magic]] in the form it is understood today. 

They predate all [[Human|humans]] and [[Elf|elves]] as the common ancestors of both heritages. They wrote in the esoteric language of [[Arckan]]. After [[the Gathering]] occurred, all traces of them are replaced with more modern ancestors, which some believe to be because of the [[Calamity of the Eyes|theft of their insight]].

A First Magician who was later named “[[Kelhe]]” was said to be able to [[Wish|perform miracles effortlessly]], and used this power to bring to life the [[Echo|memory]] of animals and plants which had died out in the previous world’s collapse. Another named "[[Trayan]]" aspired to construct a [[Tower Machine]] on the core of the planet.
