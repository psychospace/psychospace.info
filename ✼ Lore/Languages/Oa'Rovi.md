>[!question|ttl-c bg-c-blue] For in-depth details on the language, see [[Dictionary - Oa'Rovi]].

**Oa'Rovi**[^1], known to [[Shindani]] speakers as “**Primordial**”, is a language spoken in many places in antiquity, and the language of most [[Elemental creatures|elementals]]. It was granted orthography by the shaman “nurturers” of [[Kernwelt]], especially those of [[Holrfold]].

It is a descendant of a language family known as [[Arckan]]. Elementals developed this language in individual dialects based on the nature of the [[Divine Equation]] from which they arose.

[^1]: \/oʊ.ə.ɹoʊ:ve/, lit: tongue of world.
