**Lucid Sky** is the more personable of the two golem defenders of [[Aet'Caldwyn]]. Its sister-unit was [[Coursing Stream]].

Bearing an ascended halo and designed in concert with the giant forge in [[Mount Celestia]], the humanoid golem's green glass wings, originally almost like a dragonfly's, were constructed to offer immense protection against flesh-based attackers. They also act as an efficient gliding swim in case it would be necessary. It can be considered a kind of nephilim, bearing traits of both [[giant]] and angelic ingenuity. 

In the eons that have passed since anyone has offered it a challenge, Sky's uranium glass wings have shattered a hundred thousand times, though the [[Magic#Intent|aura]] they use to throw away would be absconders still maintains a phantom form of their old self.
