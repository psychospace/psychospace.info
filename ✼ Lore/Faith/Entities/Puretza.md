**Puretza** is the hexblade patron of [[Ridd of Chained-Earth]].

A mouthless katana-wielder, Puretza was a nameless "moon-entity" assumedly from [[Kibangan]]. She is originally from a far off planet within the [[Dark Sea]], but was stranded to [[The Heavens]] when her home planet, or moon, was destroyed beyond repair by her master, [[Althin]], in an act of retribution. Puretza was left without a mouth and was doomed to remain within psychospace, influencing people to take up the blades she forged from the comets, made from her moon, that fell to this planet.

[[Ridd of Chained-Earth]] retrieved a katana of such a nature in his time in [[The Below]], and slowly began to piece together the patron's name while he gained strength and called forth her shade. Ridd eventually confronted Althin in a [[dream]] world and was able to sever Puretza's fate from theirs, restoring the entity's voice.

Over time, Ridd helped Puretza influence more events, and gain more warlocks to her name, including [[Dora Maxwell]].

Puretza partly controls a piece of [[The Sheer]]. Her shade remains in this place when it is not in use, and most of her adherents can summon portals to or through the Sheer to cross space in mere moments.

It is said that she is one of many patrons partially representing the latent influence of [[Exponen]] on the world.
