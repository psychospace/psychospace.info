**Jasper Cihana Falmouth** is a [[League of Joriele|Jori]] [[Elf#Sea elves|merquarin]] and [[Witchcraft|witch]], acting currently as an [[Alect Keeper]] at the [[Fifth Institute]], serving as the keeper of [[Al Bordeaux]]. A proud representative of [[Castellan's Junction]] and one-time politician, Jasper is the longest tenured Alect Keeper, older than [[Ema Ekotoba]].

Falmouth has a vested interest in the archaeological records of the world; many of the students under her orders find it humorous that she herself is a kind of fossil.

# History
Jasper's youth was prior to the turn of the millennium, in the waning years of [[Ithuriel XI]], rendering her one of the oldest elves in politics as of [[1285 PT]]. According to her name, she was first raised by human parents, and, according to a rumor, secondly by a variety of keepers in the [[Coven of the Night]]. 

Eventually, she became a [[chirologist]] primarily in order to travel the [[Mer de Vide]], eventually becoming a chief military advisor of the Shibboleth during the [[War of the Masters]]. Midway through that conflict, she shirked her responsibility and became an [[Alect Keeper]] instead. The decision was made citing a distaste for the perpetuation of that war, feeling that it lost its initial purpose of research. 

After the war, she further gained renown through exploring and developing new techniques to map the [[Umbraid]] following its [[Zero Day|reemergence]]. Falmouth eventually helped mentor [[Al Bordeaux]], overseeing their rise to the role of [[High Manteian]].

# Abilities
Rare in the current zeitgeist, Jasper is not a [[Broadcaster]], instead being well-practiced in manners of witchcraft, useful given how the [[reality-bending|roots of new-magic]] are also the roots of witchcraft. 

According to a rumor, Falmouth's [[patron]] is her pen-pal and grants her abilities in exchange for regular letters.
