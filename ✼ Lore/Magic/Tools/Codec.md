A **Codec** is an esoteric [[New Magic|new-magic]] ability: it describes how a specific person (usually a [[Broadcaster]]) translates the [[The Signal|Signal]] they can perceive through their willpower into psychospacial [[Reality-Bending|reality-bends]]. 

The presence alters the world around it: the Codec is how that reality-change gets “broadcasted” through somebody, rather than passively into the environment. It usually marks a Broadcaster's strongest ability.

A [[Sophist]] can share their codec's benefits with another.
