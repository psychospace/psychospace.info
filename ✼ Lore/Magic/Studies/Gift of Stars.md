The “**Gift of Stars**" is an occult mystery (a [[Gift (witchcraft)|Gift]]) which brings the observer close to a reckoning of infinite potentiality. It specifically refers to one associated with [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]] and its manifestations, who traveled the stars and across [[Epitome|their lifespans]] at will.  

The Gift of Stars often takes the mental form of an endless starfield, or a body therein. By capturing this visage, one might feel powerless or small, or one might be brought to their knees at the expanse before them. 

It was the ambition of Amakudari which brought it to [[The Planet]] to share the Gift of Stars with [[Ith'Paraan]], and its hubris that the Gift brought it and its people colossal [[Bullion#Miserable Age|divine repercussions]].

 Some modern speculators hold it might be something like [[The Signal]] in that it is sourced from [[Out There|beyond this world]], which [[Syncretist|correlates]] with [[◍ Legend of Amakudari|legends]]. Through the Gift, many will realize the fundaments of [[Reality-Bending|reality-bending]].
