**Lethal Amia** is an adventurer and [[visitant]] of [[Lazuli Dino|Linnaeus]], created prior to the [[Dragonic War]]. During the conflict, he was the first visitant of this nature discovered by the [[S4]] following the [[Red Spark]], and played a key role in their journey to assemble the [[Golorr|Stone of Golorr]].

Following the conflict, Lethal was instrumental in the visitants' further endeavors.
# History

[[Ikabod's surrogate soul|Crafted]] from the prince's sense of wile and guile, he was [[Ikabod Caruso]]'s fourth creation for the purpose of curing the [[Dragonic Curse]], deemed a failure. Dormant, he was brought with the other failures to [[Drastic]] on the eve of Ikabod's presentation of his research, but the wizard would never get the chance to do so.

During the [[Red Spark]], their unconscious body fled the destruction of the [[Ivan's Tiger]] and traveled to [[Waxtown]]. There, they were quickly inducted, mostly against his will, into the local [[Spider's Web]] activities within the [[Sable Chasm]], by [[Igor Ingolstadt|Igor]]. Having narrowly escaped the Siege, the [[S4]] traveled to Waxtown for aid, and by chance ran into [[Volk Vendleberg|Volk]], whose hunt on behalf of the [[Trickster's Children]] would lead the party and Lethal to meet.

With Igor's apparent "death", and having been explained to and cared for by [[Star of the North|Star]], Lethal quickly joined the S4 as an invaluable ally with [[Psionics|psionic]] talents, source of information, and link to the missing prince. He was later mentored on etiquette by [[Frances Jayne]], on the request of [[Hieron Dredge]].

## Current Affairs
Near to the end of the war, he produced the psionic dagger which blossomed into [[Catclaw]], a key piece of restoring the prince's original persona.
# Personality
Lethal's personality is best described as the "middle child" of the visitants, jovial and tricksy, courageous, but regularly down-to-earth. Upon learning more about his original's kidnapping, he determined that it was his job to help set things right, not to turn and run. While traveling around to meet all of the other visitants, Lethal was able to assist his siblings in their recollection.

# Appearance
Lethal's appearance is that almost of Linnaeus when he was 20, though softer and more subdued. Using a mask fashioned from wood, he almost could resemble a spy, preferring long cloaks which he dyes and repairs himself. His hair is often up in a ponytail.
