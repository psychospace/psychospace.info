**Hieron Dredge** is a [[hobgoblin]] [[Wizardry|wizard]] working in the [[Tower of Electron]]. He is much smarter and more keen than he seems, and is occasionally very ego-driven by this intellect. A natural-born smart alec, Hieron works best behind the tactics of an operation.

No one would know it, but [[Arthur Graywell]] is Hieron's brother.
