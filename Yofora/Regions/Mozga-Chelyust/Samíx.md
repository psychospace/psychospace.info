**Samíx** is a settlement in [[Mozga-Chelyust]] in [[Yofora]]. 

Originally minor in importance, it grew in size as the [[Great Nortian Empire|empire]] invested more and more in research through [[NIMROD]]. There is a strange magical energy to the multitude of shores surrounding this city. There is an [[Eidolon]] guardian here.

Empress [[Bianca Nortia]] was born here following a premonition from her lord father, an event which may have given her enhanced powers.

In recent years, Samíx has encountered many hardships as magical incursions have repeatedly occurred without explanation.
