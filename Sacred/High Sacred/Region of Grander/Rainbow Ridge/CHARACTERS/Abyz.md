![[âŽ‹ Needs Rewrite]]
**Abyz** is the [[Eidolon]] defender of [[Rainbow Ridge]], embodying courage. He was originally spawned in [[1216 PT]].

He seems obsessed with books, and doubly so with the [[Divinity|gods]], and triply so with any visitors to the Ridge. He lives in the local library, and cooperates with the local law enforcement by offering up books and information as he acquires it. His symbol is a star.

Lately, his left eye has gone dead, and a puzzle-piece like scar has formed around it.
