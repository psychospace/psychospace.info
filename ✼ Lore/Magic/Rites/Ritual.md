**Rituals** are rites of dedication, often religious, undertaken to produce a specific type of outcome. In [[magic]], rituals are a form of highly-[[Arcane complexity|complex]] [[spell]], which consumes a great deal more [[Tribute]], [[Time|Time]], and sometimes talent than others. 

Whereas most spells can be completed on the timescale of minutes, rituals can take hours, [[Starfall|starfalls]], and sometimes weeks of hard work and commitment, but can reliably produce much more wondrous effects. Some studies of magic are exclusively or especially concerned with rituals: for example, [[Marmarancy]].

Rituals can also refer to "**ritual casting**" or casting a regular spell as a practiced ritual. This requires that a caster take more time to produce the same effect as a normal spell, but without expending as much of their own magical resources. For adventurers which need to conserve their energy, ritual casting offers a means of still having access to weaker spells, though at a tradeoff for preparedness and time.
