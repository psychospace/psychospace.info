**Theresa Maline "Tessa" Leighton** is a human ex-dragoon from [[Rainbow Ridge]], business partners to [[Tilly Herringbone]]. The two of them run [[Grander General Goods and Bads]] in [[Lond Point]]. 

Her upbringing was that of her wealthy father, infamous [[Transmutation|transmuter]] [[Tenora Yegim]], and his sheltered life in his sometimes lovely tower. Tessa's mother is unknown.

It is whispered that she was born with her characteristic limp, some remnant of even more ancient evil conducted at the tower [[Curse|cursing]] its inhabitants years on. Without much in the way of fatherly love, she steeped her young life in reading the many books scattered through the tower, and explored the woods with her friends.

It was partly negligence that led to Tessa's self-determinant spirit. This spirit has carried her forward to continue to assist those in need with anything they need.

She enlisted in her mid-teens. After the [[War of the Masters]] ended, Tessa had seen her fill of war, with both tours of duty concerned with the often difficult and tedious [DDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disarmament,_demobilization_and_reintegration) efforts made during the ceasefire.

She floated from job to job until hearing of the incentives given to those setting up shop in the boomtown of Lond Point, where now national hero [[Drachedion Balthazar]] had decided to build his manor.

Two months ago, Tessa attempted an entry exam into [[The Fold]] to begin an information brokering side business, but was caught in the [[Ghost storm]] (along with the proctor, a [[Shohei Integra|young man with blue hair]]) and warped back to [[Drastic]], while her proctor was taken to Rainbow Ridge. After questioning by authorities, she returned overland to Lond Point.

Tessa is married to Frederick Leighton.
