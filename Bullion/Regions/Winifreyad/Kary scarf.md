**Kary scarves**, or **Kary tapestries**, are a symbol and tradition of [[Bullion]]. Associated with the [[Institutes of Bullion]], and originating in [[Karyos]] during the [[Bullion Civil War]], the scarf is symbolically created by the accruing of knowledge and memories. It is a symbol especially of [[Fifth Institute]] high-achievers and [[Chirologist|chirologists]]. 

In each unique journey or class, a patch is created and then reinforced by the perfection of skills. Particularly potent memories will receive many additional patches attached to their sides, forming **capes**.

Even singular Kary patches, worn as pocket squares, are seen as symbols of status.
