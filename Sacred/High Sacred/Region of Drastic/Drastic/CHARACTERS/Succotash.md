**Succotash** is the Keeper of the Royal Volary atop the [[Tower of Electron]] in [[Drastic]]. Also has the titles "Rainbow Wing", "Father of the Nest", and "Master of Electron".A tall, lightly stepping [[human]] with wings growing from his cloak, Succotash is one of the more recognizable elements of the Tower in everyday life.

Succotash is the postmaster of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], answering first to the King and second to his brood of Whosits. An average citizen might know him as the [[Psionics|psychic]] researcher who keeps close to the king [[Tyranno Re Ursus|Tyranno]].

Succotash is distantly related to [[Ikabod Caruso]], whom he once sparred with, and has a faithful student in [[Werwin Krara]].

Succotash abandoned his old name when it was learned by a demon in his childhood in [[Wisfer]]. His former name is unknown, intentionally scrubbed.
