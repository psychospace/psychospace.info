The [[Spider's Web]] main line of defense against destabilization and foreign enemies is known as the **Trinity Seven**, comprised of seven lieutenants. Each of those lieutenants run their own branch of the organization.

Each member has their own abilities unique to them: one is said to be able to control the elements, one is said to be able to enthrall anything and anyone, and another is said to have control over the depths. Everything else about the Trinity Seven's abilities are baseless rumors.
