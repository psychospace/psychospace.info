**Elemental energy**, sometimes also called **elemental chaos** or *aether force*, is [[Chaos#Chaos energy|chaos energy]], tangible or [[Magic|magical]], that is attuned to and perpetuated by a natural affinity or "element".

Specifically, this energy is attuned to the four axiomatic powers of nature, being *[[fire]]*, *[[water]]*, *[[air]]*, and *[[earth]]*. Two axioms combined of the others, metal and wood, were rediscovered recently. It is best exemplified by [[Elemental creatures]], who possess these energies distilled. 

This energy and these axioms are perceived as each being necessary elements of life's existence, and balance between them is essential for full comprehension. Similar to the influence of the [[Divinity|gods]], the presence (or absence) of elemental energy afflicts the [[logic]] of the world.

Out of the many remnants, [[Bullion]] in particular has a [[Bullion#History|storied history]] with the influence of the energy.

Elemental force as it is understood today has two key origins: the [[Old world]]'s [[Echo|echoes]], who preserved the elements in their memories, and the events of [[The Gathering]], specifically the [[The Heavens|division of the whills]], which caused the various layers of [[The Planet]] to begin to attune to particular axioms.
