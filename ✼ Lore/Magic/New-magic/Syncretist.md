**[Syncretism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism)** is the practice of combining two discrete elements of culture or schools of thought, and merging them, analyzing the notion that they are related. 

The study of syncretism has proliferated somewhat throughout the arcane community as their knowledge of [[new magic]] encompasses more and more of the [[the Planet|world]]'s previously difficult to comprehend effects. The desire to explain old legends through new lenses forms the basis of this study as it relates to the Heavens.

Prior to [[Zero Day]], the most significant form of this in [[the Heavens]] was [[apeirism]]. Many [[Chirologist|chirologists]] practice syncretism.
