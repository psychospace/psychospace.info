**Eleyda** is the capital and largest city of the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]], also called the "[[Bullion#Miracle City|Miracle City]] of the Brilliant Prism".

# Description
The [[Luminaria]]'s seat of power grew from a well-defensible fortress upon [[Mount Sokron]] into a tremendously dense city of the arts, one of the most populous cities in all of the [[Mer de Vide]]. It is known famously as the **Viaduct City** for its upper city was built on the thick cliffside [[Heinslar Bridge]] over the [[Ithika River Valley]]. 

Its popular industries include the performing arts, innovations in technology, and sporting events. Owing to the local [[Second Institute]], this sprawling technical marvel of a village has been the birthplace of many a strong mind throughout its long history, almost unspoiled by war. The Helix District especially produces much research and literature, including astrologer circles and divisive "leagues" of thought.

On the other hand, many of the lower under-bridge city, as any perceived exception to the relative high intelligence the city is known for, receive inequal and harsh treatment, and often indenture themselves to earn respect from the upper-crust.

## Government
As of [[1285 PT]], the mayor of Eleyda is [[Timaeus Forsythe]].
### Eidolon
**Radin** is the [[Eidolon|eidolon]] of [[Eleyda]] as of 1285 PT. They are the embodiment of balance, and their symbol is a depiction of the Heinslar Bridge.

# History
Eleyda was founded almost two millennia ago in [[BPT 717]] after the previous capital was sieged by monsters.

In the [[3rd century PT]], the Second Institute was founded, and greatly invigorated interest and investment in the region. 

# Etymology
Eleyda is a term in Old [[MÃ¤nyya]] which means "resplendence". According to local legend, it is what [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]] itself described this valley as.
