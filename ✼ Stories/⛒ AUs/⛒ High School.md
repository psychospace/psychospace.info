**High School** is an alternate universe concept which was originally invented by the players and DM of [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]]. In this universe, the events of the games and [[The Heavens]] at large are analogized to the daily life at a modern-day high school, with each "school" representative of a different [[Remnant|remnant]]. 

It was inspired partly by art from the *Steven Universe* team's [official tumblr](https://stevencrewniverse.tumblr.com/), which had a tendency to announce the airdates of future episodes with sketches that depicted the characters and situations of the upcoming episodes as events at a high school.

As an example, in place of the events of [[⎊ Hazel's Arrival]] as they occurred, [[Lazuli Dino|Linnaeus]] is kidnapped by a "[[Nortian Conspiracy|biker gang]]" led by local bully [[Hazel Sobol]], in order to ransom him for money and medicine.
