**Hepatizon** is a magical material, said to be a sort of comet-bound stone, said to be the distilled form of [[Out There|space]] and [[gravity]]. It has a powerful [[antimagic|antimagic]] affinity.

It is left behind at the points of direct divine intercessions, as well as regularly manifested from demigod-level beings such as [[Uforia]].

It is an impure form of the more pure [[Rivenium]].
