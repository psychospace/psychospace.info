A **soul bond** or **[[Psionics|psychic]] bond** is any powerful [[Psychospace|psychospacial]] connection forged between a [[soul]] to another entity. Due to the pervasive nature of psychospace, soul bonds can become a source of strength, miracles, or danger under the right circumstance. 

Some believe this is the result of the most basic power of a soul, the ability to "connect". 

A soul bond, ontologically, is the [[Gravity|gravitational]] force between disparate [[Echo|echoes]]. The first soul bond holds one's own soul together, and that soul may then make connections to others. If that self-bond is ever broken, odd things may happen to the [[creature]] who is using that soul, such as ontological, mental, or physical illnesses or disorders.

# Examples
Members of a family, party, relationship, or organization create and reinforce soul bonds to one another just through interacting. The bond shared by [siblings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sibling) in particular is said to be powerful, even when those siblings are not related by blood.

As for some examples of how these bonds may manifest or grant strength:
- During the [[Dragonic War]], [[Serratura Neeman]] was able to tell her [[Chiave Neeman|brother]] was in danger, kidnapped to [[Dom Otdykha]], due to their familial bond. 
    - Later on, Chiave was able to tell that she had survived the [[Miraclesfield Experiment]] by the same token.
- The [[Visitant|visitants]] created of [[Linnaeus Dino]] all shared a strong connection to one another which manifested as [[Bias coagulation|bias]]-like painful emotions, even though none of them had met. Their bond to their original also eventually produced the sword [[Catclaw]].
- The [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]] created shared traumatic bonds from the process of being revived, the combined power of which among the [[‚çü Extra Innings|victims]] led to the uncovering of the [[Base (XI)|Bases]].
- [[Amanita Parasom]] and [[Octavia Parasom]], the latter being the literal [[Elseworld#Inhabitants|shadow]] of the former, were able to evade [[The Signal|the signal]] when they initially discovered it, by allowing Octavia to "retrieve" Amanita from across space. Later the two demonstrated the ability to detect one another and feel similar injuries.
