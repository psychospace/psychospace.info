**Brachi Arkaeo Falknjir**, daughter of [[Plesio Falknjir]] and [[Memoria di Alato]], was the first Queen of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. It was her who first named the island off the coast of [[High Sacred]] "[[Queen's Isle]]", as she claimed that as her own domain for foreign dignitaries to come and rest.

She had a lesbian relationship with [[Austro Raptra]] from [[Low Sacred]], forming the first notable union between the realms. Her adoptive daughter was [[Basil Falknjir]].

She was also, inadvertently, first to die by the [[Dragonic Curse]], when Basil was taken by the curse.
