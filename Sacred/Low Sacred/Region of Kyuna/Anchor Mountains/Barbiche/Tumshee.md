![[⎋ Needs Rewrite]]
M, NG satyr and [[Sen (satyr)|Sen]]’s brother. A cowardly teen who is around the age of or younger than [[Kessah]], put up to the task of town watchman by his father, [[Rigiid]]. 

Brown shaggy fro with blue dye at the ends, with freckled tanned skin that doesn’t appear to shirk from the cold. Nervously pacing. Stands guard with reconstructed bits of armor, not nearly enough to offer any real protection. If approached, brandishes a spear and bites his lip. He recognizes Kessah easily but is a little more careful of outsiders, and has never seen [[Sekkan-shin]] in human guise, only in silhouette as he passes above. Tamu knows that the war may be coming and was told strictly not to engage any hostile forces, only to trigger “Sanran” if threatened, an evacuation order passed down in legend that triggers the dragon’s protection.
