*Lady* **Serena Vostok Luszya Nortia**, [[Empress of Nortia]], is a brilliant [[Aasimar]] ranger who is the eldest of [[Bianca Nortia]]'s children, and an ally of the [[S4]] since their inception. As of [[1285 PT]], she is the present-day matriarch of the [[Nortian imperial family]].

Champion of [[Homecoming]], she is also known as *Serena of [[Bright Eyes]]*. As sister to Princes [[Iosif Nortia|Iosif]] and [[Leonid Nortia|Leonid]], and to Princess [[Lidiya Nortia]], Serena inherited the ability of [[monism]]. Her father was Prince [[Konstantin Nortia]].

Serena is married to [[Maria Simetryevna]], one of her mother's court attendants, and she also has a [[Curse|cursed]] tie to [[Hazel Sobol]]. She has an adoptive son, named [[Yevi Nortia]].

# History
Serena was brought up in the [[Nortian imperial family#Horizon Walker|horizon walker]] swordschool, particularly its novel interest in [[firearm|firearms]], becoming typical of the imperial line. The weapon called *[[Homecoming]]* was made especially for her.

In [[1230 PT]], Serena became engaged to Maria.

At the time of the [[Dragonic War]], Serena was around 45. Fearing for her life when [[Bianca Nortia]] suddenly became unreachable, followed by discovering a strange book for her near [[Burun]], she undertook the persona of **Nadezhda Naroda**, also known as "Nadia", and traveled to the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] in order to investigate [[Nortian Conspiracy|the Conspiracy]]. 

During [[Red Spark]], Serena, through [[Shohei Integra]], witnessed the death of [[Ildy]], forcing her to fully possess the boy to prevent his soul from tearing itself apart. This miracle cost Serena her [[Serena's prosthesis|right leg]]. Using Sho's body, the two of them tested the S4 in the [[Grandglass Plains]], then later infiltrated [[Dom Otdykha]], learning about the [[Nortian Conspiracy]].

When [[Volk Vendleberg]], too, experienced a premature end at the hands of [[Wren Doggabone]], Serena used her monism to rescue his detached soul as well (at a currently unknown cost), and followed him home to [[Drastic]].

Eventually, after undertaking a long vigil over pseudo-Yoforite [[Shohei Integra]], and sending the harengon [[Even Baxly]] to assist them, Serena herself joined the [[S4]].
