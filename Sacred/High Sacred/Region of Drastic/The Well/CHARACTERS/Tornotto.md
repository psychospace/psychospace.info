Half-orc woman. Bartender in 22a Bread St. She lived in Drastic all her life up until recently.

Two years ago (as of [[1251 PT]]), she was the lover of [[Shohei Integra]], but left when Sho decided to abandon the guard. Now, she operates what is in essence a gay bar, the *[[The Mute Bard|Mute Bard]]*, alongside her partner the human woman Alea Minra.
