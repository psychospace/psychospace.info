>This narration was originally used for [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]], in the scene in which [[Golorr]] was freed from its stone in the [[Vault of Foreknowledge]]. It was written by January November.
>
>This scene was performed on March 26th, 2023, as part of MMT Session 65. It consisted of nine months of planning and putting together the disparate pieces of MMT's greater lore in order to deliver a very satisfying and answering final set-piece.

# BOUND
*[The Golorr Stone seems to be reacting to the room around you.]*

*[The stone rises into the air and clicks with a hiss of air into the open imprint in the massive wall which you realize now is itself made of the same glassy material the Stone was carved from. There's a sudden flash of heat and light, blinding the room as the stone begins to glow as if turned to molten glass.]*

*[When that wave of energy washes over you, the once vibrant and verdant stone turns dull and blue, and something has changed: where there existed three glimmering eyes at its core, now, there is only a void of cracked rock.]*

>[!quote|author] Ikabod
>“It's free.”

*[As soon as your eyes catch that detail, there is another eruption of light, this time coming from beyond the crystalline wall. Inside your minds, all you can hear is SCREAMING. Your body refuses to respond to any attempts to move it. The whole room seems to lose coherency, your vision only stark shades of black and white. Beyond the bulwark where the Stone now lies, there is a flickering object taking shape, faintly visible, refracting light all around.]*

*[Noise rises and rises, until all you can hear is a single voice, a mote in a storm. Ikabod chants out, half-delirious, his voice an unusual shade of desperate.]*

>[!quote|author] Ikabod
>"Please! Please... Shard of the Eternal Snake, confidant of angels, beyond gods and men, Golorr, arise whence thou camest!"

*[There is a shimmer of recognition, a spark amid the blinding forces in the cave. The noise in your ears, as suddenly as it began, silences all at once.]*

*[The light filling the room suddenly grows into a kinetic wave which shoves you all backwards. It grows and grows in intensity as the blinking form suddenly lengthens into a slithering eel-like shape, with many tentacles emerging off of it. The water bursts as the physicality of the creature becomes coherent, sloshing over the the top of the wall and coating the ground at your feet with a layer of slime.]*

*[Your eyes finally clear with a SWOOOSH sound, and the creature in the tank beyond you... the creature which emerged from the stone of Golorr... writhes with strange electricity. Everyone, even those of you who are not magically inclined, suddenly feel very, very small: it is not unlike that feeling some of you got when you first laid eyes on the cursed prince — this primeval psionic strength.]*

*[The creature, now a shadow in the depth, swirls towards the crystalline wall: towards you all. You can see now skin, scaled skin in green and blue shades, coating the form of this leviathan. The light coursing through its veins throws rays of light all around the now darkened chamber. Its limbs slide and slap against the glassy bulwark, the dam holding it back. You feel your minds pulling on your skulls, almost like it's stretching your brains like taffy towards it.]*

*[The aboleth's three green eyes emerge through the murk and look upon each of you, its thousand-toothed maw hanging open. You feel as though you are in the presence of a god.]*

*[Your thoughts become overwhelmed with a massive voice.]*

>>[!quote|author] [[Golorr]]
We are Golorr, [[Aboleth]], beyond gods and men. We have seen four peoples rise and fall in this land. And we yearn for it all.

## Awake
>You, who hath awakened me. Raise thy meagre voices. You have come quite far, as to reawaken an ancient enemy. Tell us this. Why? What seeketh thee?
>
>You seek... the contingent reality. You seek your friend's exodus from immense clutches. You seek the closure of a dozen lifetimes cut short. And so, you have come to this precipice.
>
>Ahh. A dangerous sort. And indeed, a dangerous ally.
>Though long dead, the [[Plesio Falknjir|Great Bandit King]] was not entitled to these lands, nor was the Dios Evangel, Lords of [[Carapa Republic|Carapa]], nor were [[Angel|angels]], nor were [[Divinity|gods]]. It was us who predated them all. 
>
>Our self, Golorr, was formed as a mere tadpole when even the gods could scarcely imagine what a life would return as. It is our long-standing right to inherit these lands. And yet, the schemes of the times, modern and ancient, have led us to ponder… inheritance is useless. Control is everything. Peace is bliss. And victory is eternal. So says your people.
>
>Though our construct wishes still to one day seek the control we have forever been owed, so long as the schemes persist…. we will never possess what I truly seek. Peace… must be achieved, before conquest.
>
>We shall aid thee in this.
>
>And so it has been foretold. We shall recount the histories of the worlds, to shatter the falsehoods. For the destruction of those who bound us... this is the exchange made.
>
>You are to be forewarned that this will likely take a great time…

*[The eyes glow bright white, and the light appears to fill your ever instinct. You suddenly each feel yourselves immersed in the water at your ankles, plunged into an ethereally massive puddle... you emerge in a land of pinks and purples, this great snake-like entity floating before you, an elder force in the [[universe]], shaping the landscape you witness. You realize... you are, or at least perceive, inside psychospace.]*

*[The scene shifts as rapidly as it was created, and you find yourself standing in the middle of an ancient street on a great body of water at night: with winged people lining the sidewalks on either side of you. The city prior to [[Drastic]]: the Holy Port of Ace. Golorr begins its odyssey...]*

>As the days of the Republic waned, there was collaboration between the angels and the forest guardians, heaven and earth, to drive out Sacred invaders from the many corners they chose. When the Carapaeans worked in secret with these entities, they created a white city at the center of the Sea called [[Aet'Caldwyn]], the Lightstream Fortress. 

[On the horizon line, large, luminescent white shapes emerge from the waters, forming a palace... a colossal palace... of marble.]

>So sets your sights, as you have foreseen.

[The scene turns dark. Three shapes like statues of limestone forms appear in the space ahead of you.]

>Humans contributed ambition, innovation, and magical prowess to construct it. The angels contributed might, materials forged in the heart of [[Mount Celestia]], and their eternal bodies to protect it. The beastlanders contributed magnificent protections, splendor and beauty, and the kindling for the true heart of the Fortress, to ensure it would last as long as nature itself.

[The figures vanish, replaced by the map table of Sacred you once laid eyes on in the [[Royal Bladeworks]]. From it emerges that same shining white city.]

>The Fortress was well constructed in secret to the forces opposed, protected by the endless ingenuity of three peoples working together. Built on the intact ruins of an even more ancient civilization, before even we existed… it protects, at its center, the Citadel of the Womb, and beyond its sanctum, guarded by angels, an everlasting black fire known as the [[Invertebra]]. It was also called: the Gods' Error.

[The diorama peels away as a tiny fire, black at its core with white at its fringes, consumes the entire table in smoke.]

>This flame is what fuels your suffering. 
>
>As your people say, that… is the short version.
>
>As for the truth.

# A Start to the Endless
[The world goes dark.]

>Let us return to the time of my infancy. When I speak of such an hour, I will be using words that may be only approximations of what I was capable of witnessing.

[You blink, and you emerge in a desolate landscape, a pool deep underground, exposed to the [[Cien|sun]] through a crack in the rock. A small tadpole writhes within.]

>Once while this world was very young, a primeval entity, something like a massive body that was borne of the sky, consorted with an outsider being, from a place even higher. 

[As it describes this, the crack of light is overshadowed by a colossal galactic shape, like a cloud made out of stars. The cave falls in on itself, and the stone detritus swirls into glimmering black particles of ash, the sound of a rhythmic boom in your ears.]

>The child born from the union emerged as a mere flame, hardly without form or shape, and was made of drowned orphan ash. But the union marked the return of time to the world. The return... of meaning.

[A massive, glimmering eye of indescribable color, all-encompassing like a galactic cluster. opens in the void.]

>The [[Anti|Ignition Point]], the God of Gods, took pity on the entities that had made only spluttering fire with all their wills, and made the figures three to be without ending as consolation. This marked a genesis of a new pantheon: the new patrons of an unending legacy. 

[Statues appear in the void: one of a [[giant]], and one of a dragon. Stars fill the void, and where the glittering particles existed, now take the form of a timid statue, a shade of a baby, desperately trying to keep its cohesive physical form.]

>It is believed thus the primeval angel and outsider being from on high became the platinum drake [[Athemat]] and the sun-giant [[Cientia]] respectively: soul and time, concepts lost to the infant world, now returned. 
>
>When the union was done, seven sparks flew into the night, their heat warming one another: [[Melotte]], the conglomerate god of children and stars. Wherever Cientia smiled, life bloomed, but the flame that burned black caught a tree by a riverbed, engraving these, too, into the world's "meaning": and from this event was born [[Lex|Eriva]], of fire and of the just punishment, and [[Ordo|Tegra]], of water and of the penitent cleansing. These entities now made up [[The Heavens]] in totality.

[You blink, and everything except the ashen babe vanishes.]

>The black flame, too, earned a name. It became known as [[Arizhmiya|Lagacia]], god of history. It was the god of a legacy everlasting, a fire eternal, an ever-lengthening chain on destiny, a fixed point: as the past, it was a fated opponent of possibility itself.

[Two figures manifest as though they are the horizon in its entirety.]

>Athemat warned Cientia, 
>
>“The Past, and the fire that has and will forever make it up, causes both the greatening and the obfuscation of the darkness we both face. It will burn without end, as the Ignition Point willed: but any individual piece can burn out when the past is forgotten. With just a flicker, a grudge may lessen, but also reveal their inner fortitude: the resilience of the past, it does not like to be let go. To be sure, it must be made to flicker some day. Until that day, and forever more, we must watch over creation to ensure the [[blackflame]] can be guided to the flickering place.” 
>
>It is for this reason that the [[The Above|realm of dragons]] and [[Cien|the sun]] above it as we know it came to be.

[The formless child whimpers, aimlessly. When the sound echoes amidst you, there is the sound of ricocheting metal. You blink, and you hear the shuddering of chains, as the child, too, vanishes.]

>Lagacia was voiceless. Naught have say in the events of the past, for they have already happened. In this motion, it struggled where it laid. 
>
>It had fought for existence, been granted eternal mercy… but, in this, Lagacia had been severed from any manner of fate. It had beginning, yes, as I have told you: but cruelly, the Ignition Point had stolen its ending. And so, the past could not ever stop being a newborn truth.

>[!quote] [[Golorr]]
>Lagacia grew jealous. As other gods shifted and grew, the Past would never be more than what it began as. It was forced into this role. It had never asked for existence, let alone an eternal, lonely one, without body or name. And in this rage, it bounded and changed its form… and in this act, it committed a grave sin. 

^72fb73

[The child's body reappears, massive. Its body refuses to take shape, and so its face lifts off the writhing particle mass, becoming an unbroken mask, pulled together into shape like an array of buckyballs. You can see as it does so, those particles of ash harden into steel chain links, the face becoming clearer and clearer.]

>In this, it shunted its original vessel, rendering the "Past" truly uncontrollable, and became a facade, its degenerated shade, resembling its most core state.

[The mask turns. The shuddering of chains resonates with a colossal heart.]

>This form was its pinnacle. It called itself *Arizhmiya*, god of control, god of distortion. What it had defined itself as, began to consume it.

[The mask vanishes, and the faceless babe is left. It falls to bits, then rises, then falls to bits. Eternally without stillness.]

>From then, the ashen body — "The Past" --  it left behind still smoldered without it. When the Ignition Point completed its efforts, and departed this land gratefully… this body never faded.

[You blink, and the void field around you is surrounded by these tiny particles, no longer trying to hold a shape.]

>Even untold millennia after it degenerated, the uncontrolled fire of Lagacia's body continued to sputter and change history. Without a god to oversee the past, folded into individual aspects like science, love, and nature, the true chronology of this world was left to the whims of the elements. [[Serena Nortia|Your]] [[Apocrypha of Winds|Apocrypha]] was written in the desperation to keep the Past connected.
>
>And Arizhmiya, not keen to leave such a useful corpse to other gods, hid the babe in the stars, before tearing it, its old self, apart, for its own means. It would make a change on the destiny it could not see.
>
And to this, five-hundred millennia back from today, so it was: two embers from this flame fell to the remnant of Sacred as comets. 

# The Sin
[You blink, and suddenly, the inconceivably massive mask of Arizhmiya swoops down and slams into the field, sending out a colossal shockwave that shakes the earth. Particles form into a sandstorm, and when it fades at last, two motes of fire twirl around one another.]

[The shape of a united remnant of Sacred reappears just as [[Breaking of Sacred|both of the motes hit]] the area of [[High Sacred]] with a bassy BOOM. All time seems to slow as a cataclysm remains paused in front of you.]

>You have already traipsed near these sites. One burned across the Vale of Battle, nearly stealing victory over devils from the angels. A [[Muttermeadow|meadow that rests]] was all that was left: and within, the comet, made of only fire, was held close as a most unholy artifact. The other created an astral tether, burning a sigil into the very identity of the land, sundering it, forming the almighty [[Starcrater Fields|Starcrater]]. 
>
>These impacts distorted the landscape, forging a manifesto from rock and hellfire, and the resultant destruction caused a collateral reaction in the core of Mount Celestia.  

[There is tectonic shuddering, a colossal cracking sound. Then, all of a sudden, the opposite side of the remnant erupts with white hot lava that is jettisoned in all directions. Mount Celestia has erupted.]

[The shape rips in two, broken apart by the eruption, and begins to closer resemble the Sacred you know today. The mask overlooking all of you bows in, but suddenly finds itself torn to pieces by red fire from all around.] 

>The gods themselves well recognized the being that tore in two the world of Angels, that tore in two their throne of control. For this heinous crime, Arizhmiya's own child, the goddess of fire Eriva, bound it to its mistake forevermore. If it wanted to know its destiny, well, it had done its job: for it had sealed its fate.

[Chains bind Sacred and the mask into the vast unknown under your feet before it fades into the abyss, forgotten and forlorn.] 

>While the Muttermeadow flame had earned it's apocalyptic name, the Starcrater's flame, unfound by the routed angels as they regrouped, burned on and on. Many creatures found this flame, and small murmurings of Arizhmiya's existence, long eradicated from the divine roster, began to surface from it. However, there are two most important.
# The Union
[You hear the SWOOPING of wings as a red dragon and blue dragon land at either side of you. Their scales shining with an immense luster, they do not seem to know you are there. They lean into one another lovingly.]

>A hundred twenty millennia ago, this fire called an ancient red [[dragon]] to it named [[Sakuya and Ninigi|Sakuya, along with its blue dragon consort, Ninigi]]. Both were true rulers of the Above, monarchs in all respect: unchallenged except by metallic blood. The blackened flame, as I have told you, could not burn out, and so it incubated Sakuya's eggs for 660 days.

[That white-and-black flame at their feet is replaced with white-and-black eggs.]

>The hatching was the first of many revenges taken by Arizhmiya, a searing of "meaning" into life's aether.

[One of the eggs cracks and opens, its occupant partly emerging. It is a dragon wyrmling of black scales, with red at the fringes. You feel as though you have seen it before. It pulls free of the egg, revealing a neighbor inside the egg... a black-scaled, blue-fringed dragon, whose breath rises and falls as it sleeps.]

>The firstborn, known to itself as [[Arahabaki|Umisachi]], was said to be born blackened and scarred, as if ravaged by the dark within the flame, and was born twinned, like the land the angels called home: that Arizhmiya had made it so is no coincidence. 
>
>The twin, detached from the firstborn within seconds of life, called itself [[Uforia|Yamasachi]], and it was born a seemingly peaceful blue dragon, though it too was scarred black by the flame. Yamasachi (in Draconic, “the luck of the land”) was born a bloated and ever-growing monster that could be called abominable except for its sloth, for it eternally slept, and only spoke in the dreams of others.

[The other two eggs hatch open.]

>The two other eggs were hatched as well, but emerged, miraculously, metallic dragons of chromatic birth, an untold transgression of "meaning", and possessed none of the scorched qualities of Umisachi and Yamasachi. 
>
>Orphaned even to those under the orphan goddess' protection, the second-born [[Sekkan-shin|Hosuseri]] was known to be a silver, adventurous child, always squabbling with the third-born, a copper named [[Vergoldeter Minutenzeiger Panikdrache|Tomanoya]], who played at gilded ideals. 
>
>These metallic bastards were abandoned in the [[Giant Forest]], where it is said they found new names and new callings. These four siblings, each of a singular strange origin, would come to change the course of Sacred's history, and would, by fate, draw themselves towards one another, time and again. 
>
>It is so curious that [[Kessah|two]] [[Serena Nortia|champions]] of which now hear these words...

[You blink. Statues of the parent dragons appear.]

>Ninigi departed to [[Low Sacred]] to control the fates of their bastard children, but it was clear that both parents had suffered some [[Aphasia crystalis|strange disease]] during the waiting period, some consequence of the hatching of their firstborns. 
>
>By 660 more days following the birth, both of the parents crystallized into colossal ruby and sapphire idols, becoming relics of an unholy path, split and destroyed as the lands were.
>
>And it is here we find your antagonist. 

[The crystal dragons vanish. Umisachi, now a young dragon as large as Champo, replaces them from the darkness. Its red horns glimmer and shine like freshly-polished rubies, and his white-yellow eyes seem to pierce right through you. His veins seem to run with magma.]

>Umisachi was known to the peoples before Sacred under the epithet “[[Arahabaki]]”, a word which lacks its meaning for a reason. Heed the words we deliv'r now well…
# The Error
[The dragon raises a claw, and its shadowy scales begin to course with a familiar red and black lightning. Even in the stupor and safety of psychospace, the appearance of dragonic force suddenly shakes your confidence. A dozen figures in ragged cloak appear behind it.]

>Once Umisachi was raised to a young dragon's age, it wiped out thirteen villages simply to test its strength, sparing only the leaders of these villages to serve its whims, to know its power. The thirteen leaders were told a single secret, the truth of Arahabaki's black flame and its origins: that ash had borne ash. All it required to perform this raucous destruction was a single burning lightning bolt each, like a holy ray of lava from the deepest core of the planet cracking through the world and all its layers.

[Arahabaki presses its whole body into the fetal position, then SHRIEKS as it throws its limbs out. The entire scene instantly erupts into an explosion of red mist and arcing hellfire. Its eyes glint before it vanishes. A massive angelic guardian appears, pulling back a four-limbed bow which glimmers with holy light, bending space around it.]

>There came a judgement from the angels, a natural conclusion, that the power so wielded was not something that should strike the mortal realm. The gods called for its user's elimination, and for this, Arahabaki was put to death by an angel's arrow and earned its wretched name. 

[Arahabaki swoops out of nothing and swipes down towards all of you, but its body is altogether skewered by the might of the angelic guardian's bow. The scene then slows to a halt.]

>However, naught could kill Arahabaki. 

[The dragon writhes as more angelic guardians cast magic after magic to eradicate it. Just like the shape of Lagacia and Arizhmiya you saw before, when it is rended, the particles of its body threaten to form its shape again. The being fades from view as you stand where you did only a few hours ago... on the shore of Stygian.]

>Its rotting molecules led to the construction of [[Stygian]], in each brick bound an undying atom. Nothing concrete or coherent of it still exists, yet it remains disquieted, without the peace of oblivion forever.

[The site where the red dragon mother's crystallized form stands reappears... half the chamber filled by the blue twin, Yamasachi.]

>More carefully, the blue twin, asleep but ever monstrous since its birth, was sent on angels wing to the land where the chilling, lifeless [[The Abyss|Abyss]] dwelled, sequestering it in a city of its own make to prevent its unstable and eternal growth. 

[Serena, you recognize the twisted, ancient city of silvery marble that lies covered in moss in the crevice before you. [[Orkrengrad]], in Yofora, appears, and rain falls overhead, as the angels vanish into the structure.]

>Yamasachi was forever [[Dizforia|burdened]] with the knowledge of ash bringing ash, and the thirteen allowed to stand atop it, and, deeper within, the meaning of all of those words. Their scarred sibling ever-linked the lands by a single, immortal chain, and it was a chain bonded and forged to Arizhmiya: one that it could twist and turn to its own means.

[The scene vanishes and a short angelic guardian emerges, its halo turned gray and rotten. It collapses on the floor as a man with angelic wings, another evangel, takes the halo from the dead angel. Inheriting its soul.

>The grudge borne by the hate of Arahabaki's immortal soul burdened the angels, who were followed and inherited by the Carapaeans. It is said that no being can by itself face any one part of its soul: you must be paradoxically strong — resilient — and vulnerable — fragile — enough to confront the Past, and humans and angels were neither together… And even with such traits, you may not survive. 

# The Weapon
[The halo lifts from the evangel's hands and shatters, becoming a fuelless flame once again. Angels bind it to a [[Rune]]-enchanted fuel, and construct the entirety of Aet'Caldwyn around it.]

>And so it was they interred the damned source of its power, the black-flame, deep in an endless lockbox in the fortress, only to use that grudge when their identity as a nation depended on the darkness following them being destroyed.

[The Stone of Golorr appears in the void.]

>It was then that I was told all of this: bound and gagged until the time came for the Carapaean Contingency to break.
>
>But eagerly I did watch their fall.

[You blink and see the Holy Port of Ace again: under siege from airships with dragon wings and loosely painted starry flags. Thunder booms overhead. Cannon fire cracks the stonework around you, falling with the rain. On a bridge high above you, over the city, [[Plesio Falknjir|a man with a beard]] and long red hair, in a brigand's outfit, swings an adamantine sword at a gallant looking white-haired [[evangel]], who retaliates with a shimmering golden longsword. As they clash, throwing sparks to the streets below, the scene pauses, the weather halted midair.]

>When Lord Aso ar'Carapa, the final Dios Evangel, stood to lose his mighty republic in the last moments of his life, he called the unholy word, the name of the God's Error — Arahabaki — for the first time, bringing forth that grudging soul in desperation.

[The evangel is cleaved through the shoulder, his bisected arm clutching his golden longsword as sparks join silvery ichor and plunge to the street. Plesio Falknjir grabs for the crown adorning Aso's head with his free hand. However, he does not see Aso's remaining hand.]

[There, you see that white and black energy coalesce at the tips of his fingers. Aso shouts, "***ARAHABAKI!***"] 

[The fire suddenly lances out and pierces through Falknjir in an energy bolt.]

[Aso cries out his final words.]
>[!quote|author] [[Aso ar'Carapa]]
"Hear me! You shall forever regret the day you brought us low, forever shall your ilk weep crimson tears, as peace will eternally be a unfathomed dream. Nobody will be there to hear your lineage of sorrow, as the gods themselves tear the crown from your broken skulls, time and bloody time again. 
>
>"YOU are the Gods' Error!"

^93d843

[After a moment, nothing dramatic happens: there is no wound. Plesio chuckles, then laughs, then HOWLS with insane laughter... as though he expected more from a final attempt. He rips the crown away, winds the adamantine blade back in a [[House Dino#Revenger|familiar stance]], and CHOPS Aso's head off. Light pours from the wound as the scene turns blinding.] ^dbe070

>This conflict was yet another spark to stoke Arahabaki's flame of ambition.

[A young girl appears crouched in the pale void… with white hair and a black dress. Over her head, a black halo manifests.]
# The Curse

>This [[curse]] became known to you as the [[dragonic curse]], the shadow over the dark. It did not matter if bloodlines broke and shifted.
>
>It is so written: *the lordship over this false republic will forever be inherited by the blood of Arahabaki.*
>
>And so it began its untenable legend. [[Basil Falknjir|Basil Rhopalis Vatal Falknjir]], child of the Beastlands and adoptive daughter to the Bandit King, was sullied by this "meaning", the initial point of contact.

[The young girl turns towards you all. Her hair is turning, staining black, and you see she is leaning over the dead, burned body of her father, Plesio Falknjir. Blood drips from her mouth.]

>It rejected everything that had made her, every cell turning inwards and self-mutilating, transforming her into a whillo, until her Past self was naught but memory.

[You see, emerging from the dark, many figures. And at last, standing ahead of them all, Linnaeus.]

>Through the history of Sacred, the curse held out. Evolved. The grudge could not stagnate. Immortal to cures. And impervious to attack.

[Each of the figures each clutch their heads and SCREAM as horns, wings, and tails erupt from their forms. You see, it grows more and more violent as time reaches the present. As lightning flies from their bodies, the scene again pauses.]

>But, Sakuya, the red mother, would indirectly contribute the only hope Sacred had at survival. At the core of the Starcrater, where at one time five hearts beat within her as one, was left her last wish for the world: a single crystalline [[Dinofang|red fang]], a perfect, indestructible specimen.
>
>Wielded, crystal pierced the dragonic being as naught but a spear of rock, proving effective for the time... But to protect the royal line, it needed to be reforged: it needed to become a true weapon. Only with a divine Bladeworks, and a scabbard to contain the love and pain of its bearers' lifetimes, could the artifact fang be forged to [[Vorpal]] strength…
>
>The only thing that can overcome the curse… its own family… the Error's own kin… something burned into truth over the successive years.

[The figures standing behind Linnaeus are each killed by various wielders of the sword in silhouette, fading from sight. Linnaeus remains. Then, you see your friend: The tabaxi paladin [[Star of the North]], next to Linnaeus, placing a knowing hand on his motionless shoulder. Scared of what she must do.]

[The prince's transformation resumes. As the projection appears to overwhelm your visions, nothing remains near you all. But you see the bright red cross-spark in the distance.]
>
>The dragonic curse is not a curse of the body, but a curse of the soul, and that curse will survive so long as Arahabaki's Past does, which is to say, 
>
>forever.

[The red spark slowly fades, and you see, rapidly approaching, the fully transformed Linnaeus. No longer your friend. Lightning tangles itself in an fathomless web behind him as he flies towards you.]

[Star appears, and brings the sword towards him in an attempt to hold him back. You see the prince's eyes, blood red, as he is held in bladelock...]

[But… Star is swept off her feet in an instant, her neck rapidly torn open as Linnaeus eats her heart out of her chest. Blood showers down. Her body is tossed away, her efforts wasted. He gazes down at all of you with no sense of remorse, and no sense of recognition. As though he no longer knows you… or worse, no longer cares.]

[Yet... As he slams into you, you blink, and he is gone.]

# An End to the Startless

>But…
>
>a grudge this strong is misplaced… or can quickly burn out of control. After all, how could this being of such legend allow its power to be used by the inheritors of the Angelic Blood, the Lords of Carapa?

[You see again the moment where Aso shouted the name “Arahabaki”. Golorr again manifests as its colossal aberrant snake form, almost cheekily regarding the moment when the Carapaeans were defeated.]

>Surely, if it were watching carefully how its immortal darkness were being used, it would have never been able to have been held in the evangel's hands… for it would surely harbor such disdain for the angels that their inheritors could see no use of it… But because the curse exists still, it is clear: Arahabaki's will, its past, is unbound.
>
>And so it is that I have realized a plan to rend this wretched curse.

[Dinofang plunges out of the sky and embeds itself in the dirt.]

>The curse is limited by the medium it is passed with: as [[Volk Vendleberg|one amongst you]] has said, a blade's weakness is a wielder. Though it is esoteric and bonded with the persona and souls of the hosts, it is still physically bound to its hosts. 
>
>It is for this reason, seeking a host that it can manipulate, that not only will it skip long stretches of your people's history, falling into myth… but also, counter-intuitively that it can be cast aside and destroyed. A fatal flaw of an undying grudge: a pickiness over the history it wishes to eradicate.

[The visitants appear in a formation around the blade. A flower appears at each of their feet.]

>This was what Ikabod discovered in [[Maline Tower|his tower]], with the creation of [[Locket]]. Bonded to the persona of the prince, was a small piece of an undying, and infinitely spreading, dark void: but confined, the piece was. You will have needed the practice, as your time runs short.

[One of the visitants buckles over, a black angel's halo appearing over their head. A blast from the past hits you as their back is covered by that same blackened lock symbol that once appeared on Lethal's body.]

>As the man may have proven, the curse can be transferred from the prince to a vessel and rendered inert, but it can only be done as long as the vessel contains the blackflame from Aet'Caldwyn: made to flicker as the gods said it could be.

>Bind the origin of Arahabaki to what it hoped would be its future, as "ruler" over it all, it will remain in such a vessel. Such a vessel can then be destroyed, removing the curse forevermore. Give it a lineage with an extinction date, and it can be made extinct.

[Over them all, Linnaeus, floating, appears, coated in golden light. Inside him, a shadowy heart beats and grows in size.]

>This will have an effect on your time table.
>
>Absorbing that flame will cause the angelic parts of the royal bloodline to more strongly express themselves to try and burn away the curse, causing it to condense at its most potent position: inside the prince. The effects of this are inscrutable, even to us, but it will grant him more time. 
>
>This will both increase the power of the prince but make his burden that much more heavy, meaning that he will have both strength and fragility necessary to defeat the part of Arahabaki he inherited. 

[The visitant turns towards the prince, raising a hand. As soon as they do so, the prince's dragon wings turn stark, ashen white.]

>However, the grudge must be interred with the vessel — the blackflame alone will not do — so without your help, your prince will still succumb. Once the flame is inside the vessel, it becomes a matter of weeks before Lin becomes yet another whose burden has broken them.

[The visitant's stance falters as Linnaeus collapses into the fetal position. He suddenly throws his arms out and his horns grow even larger, his tail even longer and spinier, the wings suddenly swelling to encompass his entire body like a new shadow growing from his back. Everything again goes black.]

>With the vessel containing both the black flame of Lagacia and the wounded, weakened grudge of a soul fragment of Arahabaki by being brought before the prince, it can be destroyed... to release the world from its curse, and end the calamitous existence that has consumed the Kingdom of Sacred.
>
>And it is for this that, ah, playful and determined as Hosuseri is… I have been called back to recite my history.

# FREE
[You suddenly feel as though you need to come up for air. As all of you lurch upwards, you return to the physical present, standing now knee-deep in the cavern at the base of Stygian. You hear your hearts beating in your ears.]

>A final consternation. You cannot now retrieve the blackflame, pushing the Contingency into full effect. As part of sealing this secret, the true fortress is sunken into your [[Grand Watersea|Watersea]], bound by the weight of the world.
>
>The only way to cause the island to rise half lies in the very room you stand in. 
>
>This room is one of a pair of locks built by the strongest mortals of their time. This room they called the Vault of Foreknowledge, the pool where I was spawned, where I told them of the eons that predated them. 
>
>The other, they called the Vault of Foretelling, where the words of the Carapa Republic were first etched as a memorial and prayer for angelic boons… and where the gold of a million shining souls found its resting place.
>
>[[Critical Hit|Once.]]

[It eyes Ikabod, who looks caught well off-guard.]

>By opening and unlocking these twin vaults, filling them with water and beginning the approach to the end, you are proving you understand the meaning of bravery, and what it will take to save that which you hold dear. The Carapaeans intended these locks to prove that the one, true ruler of the lands undid the scheme they had set in motion: that peace was returned. That victory was eternal. And so providence must be proven again.
>
>Ah, but… you are more compassionate than those who made me. Though Caruso may have made a host of vessels adequate for the task… perhaps you seek an alternate path? Perhaps you believe they are more than they appear. And perhaps, you would be right. But it is far from my view to say.
>
>Just as your vessels bear the semblance of the crown, an alternate vessel must hold the semblance of true dominion. An angel's [[halo]] would suffice. Or perhaps, an object which has bridged the twin lands of Sacred and Yofora. 
>
>A vessel so burdened will possess a unholy force threatening to burn them out, and may require additional fortitude: as Ikabod discovered with the power of lifeblinding. And such, we enter the waters of improvisation. Your ingenuity has defeated fate times before, and it shall again.
>
>Your task forward remains the same either way.
>
>In doing so, you will also free us. We have been bound to our spawning pool by the Stone, but by shattering the falsehoods, the Lords assumed we would remain bound before raising the water. There exists no quarrel between us… though we earnestly hope our thanks for our freedom in the form of knowledge hitherto unknown acts a goodly bargaining chip in our collective fate.
>
>We fear you have bigger fish to fry, anyways.
>
>To reiterate.
>
>Once the water is lowered, seek the Citadel of the Womb, and wield your chosen vessel to contain the whole of the planetbound black-flame within. Once done, bring that vessel before the prince, face the manifested grudge head on, and weaken it so that it may bind to your vessel in desperation.
>
>Then, destroy it, emerging with the fang of Sakuya burning bright as your future. With the grudge destroyed, all shall at last be healed.
>
>With this, the prince's soul will be released… and you will have Linnaeus again. The future of Sacred will be secure, and all that would remain unwritten from now is your confrontations with the powers that sought to confine him...
>
>In the end, the land's cycle will be broken. The syzygy will be forged as past connects to present and then on to the future.
>
>Go forth. Seek truth. Let the beginning find its ending...
