**Harengon**, also called **yutu**, are a #sapient ancestry of small-statured, leporine [[kinfolk]] people borne of the [[Dark Sea]], and are [[fey]]-adjacent. Like their sister ancestries in [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and [[goblin|goblins]], modern harengon have some of the oldest common origins.

Like [[gnome|gnomes]], it is believed by most that harengon were native to, but at some point left, [[Kibangan]], taking with them their eccentricities and wanderlust. Myths of their origins vary from there, however. It was supposedly the advent of the [[Folly of the Twins]] which initially brought them into being, borne of moondrops that fell as [[soulstone|soulstones]].

In any case, harengon have since cultivated a reputation as farmers, miners, and adventurers, especially in [[Bullion]], where they have a rich history as descendants and original inhabitants of [[Deepdell]] in the [[Siella Valley]].
