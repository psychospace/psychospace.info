**Paletta** is a local eladrin lord who presides over a mostly failing estate on the shores of [[Hope Springs]]. The estate prided itself on experimentation on plants, and especially with giving motion, life, and voice to plants. They are an eladrin and often travel, leaving the estate to run itself. However, as of late, the estate has fallen into such disrepair and rampant overgrowth that they cannot even return to it on their own without risking injury.

They grew up in Low Sacred, near to the phantasm where the Whiskerwood lies. But practicing their talent of animating plants was not so easy when the dryads and nymphs were already protective of, disapproving of, and doing just that. Instead Paletta moved, alongside their eladrin siblings, through Cherryheart and up to Hope Springs, where the "Grandmaster Gardener" was said to live.

Thankfully, being the bumbling buffoon of the upperclass in Hope Springs has its advantages: Paletta is friends with many of the local businesses whom were their buying audience once upon a time.
