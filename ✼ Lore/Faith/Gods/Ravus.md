**Ravus**, also known as the **night mother** or the **Midnight Scouring**, is the mother [[Divinity|deity]] of [[Elf#Drow|drow]] and custodian of the night, and in particular the overseer of the [[Dark Sea]], an important protective barrier for the pantheon. It also apparently oversees the [[Elseworld|elseworld]].

A trickster god, Ravus's job within the pantheon is to observe other gods and ensure they do not overstep their bounds. As counterpart to [[Cientia]]'s control over light, Ravus has a control over darkness, and thus often works for other deities (given that her abilities are quite useful).
