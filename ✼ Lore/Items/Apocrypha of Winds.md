The **Apocrypha of Winds** (*Apokrif Eolovyj*) are mysterious ancient artifacts of the [[old world]], which appeared to have predicted the shape of the world that followed.

# History

According to legend, an ancient [[Old world|pre-Shatter]] civilization once inscribed several hundred books worth of algorithmic categorizations which were said to potentially foretell the coming of the gods and the subsequent rapture of land, person, and property.

However, these texts were inscribed in a form which was almost entirely lost to the existential destruction caused by the [[War of Chaos]]. It is believed by some skeptic groups that the contents were largely early revelation and discovery (by what must have been advanced instruments) of the [[Divine Equation]]'s roots, which would have begun to emerge from the [[Chartless Sea]] around that time.

Of the thousands of these analog databanks which must have existed in the face of their annihilation, only 25 are known to have survived in various forms, rumored or attributed following the [[unknown era]]. The interfaces to access the databanks were even harder to come by considering the re-shaping of the world.

## Current Day

Today, only four can be said to exist in any readable state, each of which was initially saved and translated by the [[First Magicians]]; they were transformed from their initial medium into religious texts. Inside this form, much of their contents have been interpreted for performance. Together, they form [[the Planet]]'s understandings (almost in totality) of the old world. These volumes also help to catalogue loosely the remains of missing data.

One relic of this set was found in [[Xvaka]] in [[Yofora]], at the supposed origin point of the [[dustwall]]. This relic in particular became a holy symbol of the [[Temple of the Uforiad]].
