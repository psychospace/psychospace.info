**Arahabaki** (meaning unknown), also known by its birth name **Umisachi** or by its epithet as **the Gods' Error**, was a red [[Dragon#umbral|umbral dragon]] borne of the [[blackflame]].

According to [[Golorr]], as its [[Arizhmiya|origin]] did, it hated the gods and wished to sit the throne of creation by blowing open a hole into [[Welkin]]. 

# History

When it was born to [[Sakuya and Ninigi]], conjoined with its twin [[Uforia|Yamasachi]], inside the [[Starcrater Fields]], it quickly gathered near-[[Divinity|divine]] abilities, able to subjugate nearly the entire [[Remnant]] of [[High Sacred|Carapa]] with its burning lightning. 

However, despite its efforts, it was judged unworthy and assassinated by [[Angel|angels]]. Its [[Body]], like its source, was without end, and would rise again and again no matter what efforts were made. This is why it became known as its unholy epithet, as though it and its source were a mistake made by the gods. Tangentially, this caused the exile of its twin.

To contain it, each atom of its body was placed brick by brick in the construction of [[Stygian]], though its grudge against the angels had built and metastasized, burdening them by destroying their [[halo|halos]]. 

## Persistence
Eventually, when the [[Carapa Republic]] inherited this grudge, they decided to create the [[Invertebra]] and [[Aet'Caldwyn]] as a direct result, to ensure the grudge could be used as a weapon. This weapon was eventually used against [[Plesio Falknjir]], though when it appeared to do nothing to save the final lord of Carapa, it appeared to be all for naught.

Arahabaki's sense of self would manifest time and again as the invasive persona of the [[Dragonic Curse]], especially through the [[Dragonic whillo]] though it had degenerated through its time so disconnected as it was.
