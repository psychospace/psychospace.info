A **petitioner** is any entity which is the final form of a [[Death|deceased]] [[soul|soul]] once it has been ushered through its judgement at [[Unwri]]. 

Though time may pass between and before sentencing and transition, in the process, a soul fuses with its *[[Fylgja|fylgja]]*, undertaking a transient form in accordance with that judgement, and passes to the plane of its eternal rest or duty, usually in the [[Scarlet Skies]]. Petitioners might resemble their original lost [[body|form]] in distant, misbegotten ways.

When a petitioner is killed, or carries out its sentence, its energy returns to [[Mana (plane)|Mana]] so it can be fully [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]]. This is when its true [[Epitome]] finally ends.
