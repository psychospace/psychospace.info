**Valerie Stout** is a student of the [[Fifth Institute]] who was a friendly contact to [[TRUE NAME (collective)|TRUE NAME]] for a time. Hailing from [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Winifreyad]], she is a relatively well-off researcher, specializing in the field of archaeoarcanology, the origins of magic.
# History

In [[1249 PT]], Valerie was late in her research at the Conservatory and was vying to become a [[High Manteian]], effectively climbing the bureaucracy of the Fifth Institute to become an important figure in her field. Working on a thesis on [[Confluence|confluxes]] in the [[Upper Kernwelt]] region, she rented out the basement of [[Julia Gutierrez]], a newspaper editor from [[Ziegfeld Station]].

One month after [[TRUE NAME (12-242)|a body of TRUE NAME]] was revived by [[The Pitcher]] and divorced from the collective, Valerie was contacted by TRUE NAME. She offered them a job, helping unpack her [[Bag of holding|bags of holding]] full of notes into an esoteric organization system. Valerie also encouraged Julia to offer the bounty through the [[Daily Grind]], hoping to research the entity that 12-242 was revived by.
