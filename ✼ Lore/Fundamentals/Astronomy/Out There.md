The **Out There** is a modern colloquialism given to the collection of [[Plane|planar]] and plane-like structures which permeate all existence, harboring things like [[The Planet|the Planet]] and its [[Antic Sea|world sea]].

It is also called **Graciosa**, the **Outer Planes**, **Neverside**, or **[outer space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space)**, depending on the culture. 

# Composition
Nobody in the Heavens is quite aware of where the Out There came from, though a general consensus exists that it emerged from the [[Chartless Sea|Chartless Sea]], a plane of energetic expansion.

Precisely stated, there are two intermediate states of the Out There: [[Manifold Seas|manifoldness]] and [[Chartless Sea|chartlessness]]. Entire regions can be divided cleanly between them: near-stellar "planetary" space, and interstellar "void" space. The former is governed by the influence of [[star|stars]], and the latter is governed by the tenuous influence of [[Outsider|Outsiders]]. ^6df3cf

## Ontology

Almost all places which constitute the Out There are definitively beyond the concern of [[Welkin]] and the [[Divine Equation]], and many exert varying degrees of presence on the planet. It exists as a place of unimagined potential, existing alongside and permeating time and space. 

In some views, the Out There is [[Plane#Super-pyrean|super-pyrean]] because it presumably contains many [[Kibangan]]-like planes which create varying experiences of reality. 

As a general rule, establishing a coherent [[context]] in the Out There is difficult if not impossible due to a lack of familiar [[logic]], and conversely, the Out There may [[Reality-Bending|impose]] incongruous contexts on the planet.

# Denizens

In the times of [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] scholars^[Whose ruler [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto|Amakudari]] transcended the Out There], studies showed that outer space is vacuous and contains a virtually infinite swill of [[Void energy|negative energy]].

[[Illithid|Mind flayers]], mysterious as they are, were supposedly once a space-faring race which found a small foothold in our world, losing the secrets needed to leave it[^illith], and so pursue self-evolution mercilessly. Other [[Aberration|aberrations]] such as [[beholder|beholders]], [[Aboleth|aboleths]], and others also emerged from the Out There or its effects on the planet.


[^illith]:  Some say this occurred by passing into the Dark Sea. However, others theorize it is connected to the [[Calamity of the Eyes]], during which [[Imagi]] was active.
