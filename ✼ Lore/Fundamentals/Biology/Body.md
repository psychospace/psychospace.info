Within the context of biology, a **[body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_(biology))** is the literal, [[Plane#Realm|physical]] form of a [[creature]], connected to its [[Soul|soul]] and [[Echo|shadow]] by the [[silver cord]]. [[Death]] of the body is equivalent to death of the soul in typical circumstances.

It is known that many [[Divinity|gods]] have had bodies, which have since ascended into [[Welkin]] as part of the [[Mortal God Ritual|process]] of becoming [[immortal]].
