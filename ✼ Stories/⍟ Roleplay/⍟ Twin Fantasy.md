***Twin Fantasy***, also known as **2F**, the "Bullion campaign", or "**Campaign 2**", is a prospective campaign, to-be-run in the Pathfinder 2e system. In-universe, *Twin Fantasy* furthers the timeline to [[1285 PT]] and takes place on [[Bullion]], a diverse remnant flush with mystery, progress, tradition, and opportunity.

It will be GM'd by January November, and acts as the follow-up to [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]], though it also stands on its own.

It was split into two groups and thus two origins: "Mirror to Mirror" and "Face to Face". The latter meets primarily in-person, while the former meets primarily online. Though the games occur contemporaneously with each other, they follow different storylines and explore different themes.

*Face to Face* began on July 1st, 2024. 

# Summary
## Face to Face
Enigmatic [[new Magic|new-magic]] has become the zeitgeist driving a whole generation of adventurers, criminals, and warriors alike to fear the unknown and seek strength where they can find it. Meanwhile, [[dust tunnel|leywire]] networks and [[train|trains]] stretch from coast to coast, connecting disparate folks to each other and to the future of technology.

As agents of the inexplicable amass mystical power, the tranquil, ancient countryside of the [[Aed & Maed]] finds its most rural communities threatened without recourse, in dire need of a guiding hand. Heroes are themselves rising to meet the challenge, spurred by rumors to seek the mythic town of '[[Empty Lake]]': an apparent place of sanctuary, hidden away from the threats of the changing world.

It just so happens that some of these fresh-faced [[Wildwalker|cowpokes]] are about to cross paths along the meanders of the [[Rio Insólito]], in the nowhere-hamlet of [[Fournier]]...

## Mirror to Mirror
The *nouveau riche* of [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qaulhain]] and [[Sirrhad]] — carpenters and entrepreneurs who helped the remnant recover from the [[Great Hurricane]] some 33 years ago — have formed a new caste. 

Attached to the hip of every heavy-industrial outfit helping maintain the [[train]] or [[dust tunnel|power network]], or every mail-order housing company at the backbone of mining towns, is what are being termed “[[Insight & Opportunity]]” departments: small branches employing itinerant adventurers, paid for by heads of the company to help them seek out sources of new power — new magic power. These are no mere [[wildwalker|cowboys]] — they are enforcers, organized, terrible, and glorious, often led by the promise of payroll and the allure of the unexpected and dangerous. In other words, you’re here because you’re wild, and they’re paying you to be pointed at something they want.

In the desert metropolis of [[Aschalas]], you all have found your way into this role, though despite what claims to fame you might have, you start, as many do, on the bottom rung, to investigate a defunct weather-control station high up on [[Ginsanga Mountain]] — a forgotten property of [[Fennelly Pteronautics|your company]]’s [[Jam Fennelly|founder]], said to be infested with [[chaos]] energy. Much like the group of *[[#Face to Face]]*, maybe some day you hope to take your interests solo, to seek out that Empty Lake — but for one reason or another, you can’t pay the price of freedom just yet. If there’s one thing you do know, it’s that you expect not to know what your boss is really after until you’re already knee-deep in it.

So, what are you waiting for? Get the train ticket, get your shit together, get ready to write down whatever the hell you see out there. It’s time to earn your cut.
