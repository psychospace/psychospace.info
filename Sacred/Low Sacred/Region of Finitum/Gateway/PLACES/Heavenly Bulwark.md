This massive pseudo-castle fortress makes up much of the northern half of the city of [[Gateway]], known as the **Heavenly Bulwark**. 

The original fort built to protect the region, the Bulwark connects to the Westwall and, through ancillary conduits, [[Fort Tetsudo]]. Its scope is no mistake: each of its towers are mounted with arrow-ballistae, energy ballistae named *[[Filistec|filistecs]]*, and bells that ring to alert certain companies of the guard. Nearly endless corridors, classrooms, stone walls, barracks, armories, and training fields fill the complex. A bridge connects it back to the middle of the city, and below this bridge lies a course for capture-the-flag.

The Bulwark acts as the military centrepoint of North [[Low Sacred]].

There are dragoons guarding the gate, armed with curious weapons that look like crossbows without the bows (these being firearms). The interior of this foyer area complex is open air to allow for griffon flight and [[Klemma]]'s patrol, although the ceiling is defended by crossbars of iron which look like massive swords stuck through the side of the keep. At the very back of the fortress is a secret passage to a hidden stable, for use by the royal family.
