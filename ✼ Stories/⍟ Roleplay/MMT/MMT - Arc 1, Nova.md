***Nova*** was the first arc of [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]], covering the [[S4|Royal Escort Group]]'s efforts to travel with Prince [[Lazuli Dino|Linnie]] and [[Ildy]] to return to the capital. It took place over the latter half of the month of [[1250 PT#Gewalt (12)|Gewalt, 1250 PT]], as well as shortly into [[Augenschein]].

In *Nova*, Linnaeus and [[Ildy]], stranded by a spontaneous [[Ghost storm|purple storm]], request the formation of an escort group to take them the long way home to [[Drastic]]. Beginning on [[1250 PT#12-11-1250|12-11-1250]], the party unites on the doorstep of the [[Maline Tower]]. Along their travels into [[Low Sacred]], they repeatedly encounter a dangerous cult known as [[Heartknock]]. At the end of the trek, the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]] occurs, [[⎊ Hazel's Arrival|rendering Linnaeus]] on the verge of succumbing to his secret [[Dragonic Curse]]: and setting his friends on the path to revenge. ^1e4d07

# Events
### 12-11-1250 
*[[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]]* begins on the doorstep of the [[Maline Tower]] in [[Rainbow Ridge]].

[[Arthur Graywell]], [[Shohei Integra]], [[Chiave Neeman|Chiave]] and [[Serratura Neeman]], and [[Eldral Levin]] accept the call to action put forth by [[Ikabod Caruso]], traveling to the [[Otell Sanctum]] to rescue [[Pendant]] in exchange for renown and a good word put in with Prince [[Lazuli Dino]], whom Ikabod has been helping these past weeks.

### 12-12-1250
The adventuring party rescues Pendant from the Sanctum deep within the [[Rainbow Caverns]], slaying the duergar mind master. While sieging the Sanctum, the party spotted a mysterious figure named [[Phys]], wearing a [[Shiny Mask]], who teleported away, swearing revenge on Ikabod. Pendant is returned to Ikabod, though the parting is strained.

### 12-13-1250
The Ides of Gewalt arrives, as does the prince's test to recruit an escort group.

[[Ikabod Caruso]] is attacked by [[Phys]] using a massive mecha, and the party stops the mecha; [[Trobairitz|Santo]] flees his tower for good. Impressed by their bravery, Prince Linnaeus recruits Arthur, Serra, Sho, Chiave, and El as his [[S4|escort group]]. The escort group sets out from Rainbow Ridge, traveling through the night along the [[Sienn Byway]].

### 12-14-1250 
Linnie's escort party, traveling through the night, arrives in [[Ladybug]] in the morning. Through some slight detective work, and through a game put forth by a triton named [[Hikawera]], the party successfully eliminates a venomous troll terrorizing the city which apparently teleported under that city. The party stays the night in town, in an inn called the Twist Ending.

### 12-15-1250
The party travels into the Precipice Plains, spotting a few strange things, and camps out in a strange outpost near a cave (coming across [[Chance Seria]]'s final note). That night, [[Star of the North]] falls from the deck of the [[Aerkastelo]], escaping the clutches of sky pirates. Star is recruited to the party.

### 12-16-1250
The party travels into the region known as the [[Giant Forest]]. They traverse this area into the town of [[Cherryheart]], and prevent the Aerkastelo from crashing down onto it. Wishing to heal the ailing [[Heart of the Woods]], they travel into [[the Beastlands]] to find its counterpart, the Tree of Time. They rest in Chiave and Serratura's childhood home in [[The Whiskerwood]].

### 12-17-1250
The party travels from the Whiskerwood to the [[Tree of Time]], eliminating a band of goons wearing shiny masks, sparing a number of them and coming into contact with [[Kingdle Coal]], their apparent superior. Coal teleports away, leaving the band of goons a failure. This band of goons is seemingly just one of a larger cult known as the School of Heartknock. Each of the ones the party spared were actually pirates who had hijacked the Aerkastelo. 

After eliminating the threat and destroying the Dark Brainframe corrupting psychospace, the party leaves the Beastlands, leaving Chiave to complete his training as a druid. After leaving the pirates in the Prison of Slabs and successfully atoning the Heart, restoring its true nature, a new [[eidolon]] is born to defend Cherryheart, named [[Nist]]. A plan is devised to search for a captain for the [[Aerkastelo]], to escort the ship back home to [[Archipel]] upon their duty's end. The party then camp in the desert.

### 12-18-1250
After a chance meeting with a strange formless cleric named [[Enoch Starfell|E.T. Starfell]], the party arrives in [[Midzone]], and to best assure the safety of the prince going forward, recruit the disguise expert [[Alexios Hawthorne]] at the gates. While shopping at the [[Bazaar of Fools]], the group runs into “Santo”, who has now taken the name [[Trobairitz]]. 

In their reunion with the party, the party crosses paths with Starfell's lost journal, retrieving it and discovering a wealth of knowledge on the remnant of [[Yofora]] and the monsters and mechanisms which dot its landscape. The party resolves to return it to Dr. Starfell, and stay the night in the Looking Glass Inn.

### 12-19-1250 
Serratura catnaps a bag of tricks, while Arthur pores over the journal. That evening, the [[Bazaar of Fools]] is attacked by [[Heartknock]]: while most of them self-destruct, [[Magnet (tiefling)|a tiefling]] remains dead, and could provide intel on the School. After preserving the body with the help of the local guard, the party stays another night in the [[Looking Glass Inn]].

### 12-20-1250
The party, in some haste to resurrect the tiefling, leaves Midzone with a new mount in tow, named [[Betelgeuse]]. The party traverses [[Beastmaw Canyon]], before resting in an old fort.

### 12-21-1250
The party, continuing to rush, leaves the canyon, resting in the desert.

### 12-22-1250
The party travels through and rests in [[Monument Yard]].

### 12-23-1250
The party rests near the stronghold of [[Krydda]].

### 12-24-1250
The party arrives in [[Gateway]], meeting Buttons and Snooze at the gates (who join the escort group as they desire to go to Drastic for assistance with their blood curse). The tiefling [[Magnet (tiefling)|Magnet]] is revived at [[Destiny Cathedral]] and reveals that the School of Heartknock recruits from those who harbor anxieties against the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. That night, at the [[Clear Skies Pub]], the prince reveals his own cursed nature to Star to secure her confidence.
### 12-25-1250
The party, searching for a captain for the [[Aerkastelo]], have a second meeting with [[Hikawera]] in [[The Money Pit]]. Afterwards, the party continues on to [[Wisfer]], arriving late.

### 12-26-1250
The party embarks upon [[Logan Caruso]]'s [[Logan's Bastion|Bastion]] in search of magical knowledge. Afterwards, the party continues on towards [[Hope Springs]], and rapidly deals with a plant issue. The party stays the night in the coastal town.

### 12-27-1250
The party travels up the Bandit's Road towards Drastic, and camp in a roadside forest.

### 12-28-1250
The party continues towards Drastic at breakneck pace, passing through the Starcrater Mines. That night, the party, camping on a cliff, dreams of strange images.

### 12-29-1250 
The escort group finally completes their goal. At midday, the party arrive at [[The Well]], and are greeted by [[Vyctry]], Dora Maxwell, [[Cefal]], and [[Hieron Dredge]]. Meeting with the Queen, the party is awarded the [[Sacred Royal Ultra|Royal Ultra]]'s badge, the [[Nova Star]], as well as the Beatific Keep and the cash prize.

### 12-30-1250
After a night of fixing up the keep, the party holds court with Eldral's sister: [[Isadora Ilacqua|Isadora]], and [[Windriders|her party]]. During the lunch, they realize that Buttons and Snooze have gone missing on their own for a cure. Hunting them down, the party finds a number of clues that lead them into a shaky alliance with another someone searching for a missing person by the name of [[Ruby Reno]]. However, at the end of the day, they are apparently gassed and pass out.

## [[Augenschein]]
### First of Augenschein
The party awakens, having been kidnapped by a noble family in the Well who does trafficking. The [[Ashton Orpheus Albatros|Ace of Gold]] frees them, but due to the alchemy they'd been plied with (as well as trauma in the days to come), the party's memories of the subsequent events are shaky. What is known is that Ace gave Serratura a mystery key, Buttons and Snooze were rescued and kept safe, and the family was brought to justice by Vyctry, the vindictive eidolon of the Well.

### Second of Augenschein 
The prince and Star train together in the afternoon. The final preparations for the Summit are made. Ikabod arrives in Drastic with all the visitants, intending to bring his findings before the crown after the Summit. Elsewhere, Volk begins a mission to the Grandglass Plains. Elsewhere still, Kessah gets immensely drunk at a party in Pendulum, and is arrested for disorderly conduct for the night.

### Third of Augenschein
![[Red Spark#Events| no-h]]

### Fourth of Augenschein
That morning, the party is “tested” by a strange entity known as [[Serena Nortia|Nadezhda Naroda]]: with a well-placed lightning smite, they are repelled (and appear to be Shohei). 

The Red Diamond continues on towards [[Waxtown]].
