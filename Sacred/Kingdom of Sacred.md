The **Kingdom of Sacred**, also known as the **Dino Royal Lands**, are the authority controlling the twinned [[Remnant|remnants]] of [[High Sacred]] and [[Low Sacred]]. It is ruled by a [[House Dino|monarchy]] and a council of dukes, and its capital city is in [[Drastic]]. Its symbol is a [[Star|five-pointed star]].

The twin remnants of Sacred are reflected in its people, deliciously diverse yet decidedly unsure of one another. Since the two are bridged by only the [[Eight Bridges of Sacred]], three of which are on the flipside, not many people from High Sacred ever see what Low Sacred has to offer.

The demonym is "*Sacreder*" or "*Sacredite*".****

# Traditions
The military of the Kingdom is known as the [[Sacred Dragoon Force]]. Its policing force is the [[Victory Starscouts]].

The Kingdom of Sacred names [[Year (unit)|years]] of great import, and years in-between as having been "Year Beyond" initially or "Year Two After X" or so on, using named years as a baseline for unnamed years. If it's easier, some people (mostly in Low Sacred) utilize terms such as "Year Before" or "Year Two Prior To X" when constructing frames of reference to long lengths of time between striking events.

# History
The previous inhabitants of this region were the [[Carapa Republic]].

During a many-year conflict which began in [[742 PT]], [[Plesio Falknjir]], a bandit king from Low Sacred, overthrew the Republic. His family and those who have kept the crown's lineage intact have since become known as [[House Dino]], and act as the present day rulers of the land. When Plesio was about to overthrow the [[Drastic|Holy Port of Ace]], it was said he saw a star fall from the sky in the lands now known as the [[Starcrater Fields]].

According to legend (and the [[Aboleth]] [[Golorr]]), with his dying breath, the last lord of the Carapaeans [[Curse|cursed]] the crown with the [[Dragonic Curse]], which has repeatedly ravaged the royal line.

After the Kingdom's founding, the new government made peace with the Low Sacreders and gave them a centralized government and a say in how the kingdom was run, vastly different from their predecessors in the [[Unitor|Unitors]]. This sort of “invade and then apologize later” mentality hasn’t faded for the entire span of the Kingdom, and even with representation many people in Low Sacred are concerned that Highs don’t care too much for them or simply treat them as lesser.

The [[War of the Masters]] gravely affected the region, leading to widespread common sentiment against the monarchy.
