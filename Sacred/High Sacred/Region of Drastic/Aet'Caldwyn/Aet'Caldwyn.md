**Aet'Caldwyn** is a holy site on an island in the [[Grand Watersea]], commonly translated as "Lightstream Fortress". Off-limits to the public. 

Its true form is that of a full island city, hidden away by a complex water lock sealed by the [[Vault of Foreknowledge]] and the [[Vault of Foretelling]]. Deep inside was the full remnants of the [[Blackflame]], origin of the [[Dragonic Curse]]. It was long protected by [[Lucid Sky]].
