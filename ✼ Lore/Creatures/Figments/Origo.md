An **origo**^[ohr-RIH-goe], sometimes called a **personal eidolon**, is an arcane term given for a [[figment|figment]] which can manifest^[physically, outside of[[psychospace]]] with the aid of an anchor, that serves as its mortal conduit. 

Just like traditional draconic [[eidolon|eidolons]] and the community which brings them about, origos are immaculately [[Soul bond|connected]] to the [[soul]] of the anchor, and may not be able to survive without them. The anchor may or may not be aware of the true origins of the origo, either.

Some argue that describing an origo as a unique form of figment limits its definition. As described [[Figment#^812b62|on this wiki]], similar to a [[Fylgja|fylgja]] or [[familiar|spirit familiar]], many figments require a soul bond to operate: a dream needs a dreamer, after all. However, the more precise definition is that an origo has *no* form with which it can interface with the world â€” that is, without its anchor.

Some origos which have been uniquely identified include [[Puretza]]'s shade.

The study of [[summoning]] describes the complexities and improvements of the connection between anchor and origo.
