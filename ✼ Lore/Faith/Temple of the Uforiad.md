The **Uforian faith**, known more prominently as the **temple of the Uforiad**, is a worship which is a mainstay of [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] culture. 

The **Uforiad** is the collective name for [[Uforia]] and all her creations and manifestations, who exist in many mythological states but most commonly through the [[Nortian imperial family|imperial line]] that began with [[Valerian]]. Many believe all acts of the Uforiad, including creating the [[Cradling Hand]] and the [[Dustwall]], were to bring about the modern day, to bring about their times of peace.

The *temples of dream*, from [[MÃ¤nyya]] "*shell sites"*, are religious locations of worship for the Uforian faith. They are often constructed as inverted pyramids. The temples are called *shell sites*, due to the mythological significance of Uforia's shell. Depictions of shells and eggshells in their decorations are not uncommon.

# Tenets
Acts considered holy to the temple are largely defined as assisting the downtrodden and advocating for the peaceful existences of all life. 

Through the temple's reverence, her temples act as both church and hospitals of sorts. There, rest and medical aid is offered through ritual offerings and meditation, giving meaning to the gift of [[Monism]]. Also considered a rite of passage are expeditions to [[Orkrengrad]] and attempts to map and understand the dreams of Uforia.

Acts considered anathema to the temple involve actively harming others in "unhelpful" ways, interrupting those of other faiths, acting outside of virtue, and polluting the world with the influence of [[The Abyss|The Abyss]].[^1]

# Leadership
The worship differs slightly across [[Yofora]] and [[Umazia]]. Preaching steadfastness through hardship, the temple's leaders, the ***Dicastery of Shields*** (so named for [[Ekaitz]]'s title and role as Uforia's voice), make regular announcements to the public on both local and national scales, called **incipits**.

The equivalent role to a bishop of the Uforian faith is an **Orchestrator of the Dreaming Dragon**, with the Empress and [[Successor (Nortia)|Successor]] both known as **Prime Orchestrators**, serving an important ecclesiastic position.

[^1]: [[Tiefling|Tieflings]] are not considered anathematic, as the Dreaming Dragon understands that these children are not agents of the [[Scarlet Skies]].
