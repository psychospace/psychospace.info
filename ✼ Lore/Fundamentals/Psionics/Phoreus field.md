In [[psionics]] and [[magic]], a **phoreus field** or simply a **phoreus** is a model of the influences of multiple [[Psinomenon|psinomena]]. Analysis results in a [vector field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field) which maps local real-space to [[psychospace]], and describes expected outcomes of fundamental forces like [[logic]], [[chaos]], and [[gravity]]. 

Its name comes from its nature as a "carrier field", describing the rough flow of [[Vibe]] as it interacts with external forces. A phoreus field usually appears in the context of the range or shape of [[Spell|spells]], or the directed-nature of a particular [[confluence]]. 

The creation of a phoreus model requires sufficient [[senzai]] or tools designed to augment them.

When referred to in studies of [[automagic]], a phoreus field is often a helpful map of all influences in the system, or of particular energies and energy sources, as well as the expected results of introducing or removing these sources.
