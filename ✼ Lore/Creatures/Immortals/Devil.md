A **devil** is a member of a family of [[Fiend|fiends]] from the obverse sides of the [[Scarlet Skies]], or, more broadly, the Hells. Devils are usually lawful evil, and typically field abilities useful when harrying escape attempts from the wandering damned, such as [[telepathy]], darkvision, or blood magic.
