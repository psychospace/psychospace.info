**Lenore Arviel** is a [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|Paraani]] [[elf]] [[Summoning|summoner]] currently active as a [[High Manteian]], who specializes in unraveling various objects, especially the [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpins]]. 

Arviel has long served as an effective treasure-hunter for the collective. Kept by new-blood [[Valerie Stout]], and once-mentored partly by [[Mujtaba Shahin]], Arviel is considered very old-school by her peers, sometimes quite literally: her actions and idiosyncrasies calling back to traditions which began at the [[Fourth Institute]]. 

Assisting in this view is the fact that Lenore is among the older members of the retinue of [[Alect Keeper|Alect]] staff at the [[Fifth Institute]], as of [[1285 PT]] -- she is nearly 200 years older than [[Sanza Rayo]], after all.

# History
Though Arviel does not speak much to media, it is known that she was born a high mercantile-noble of [[Anacoreta]] as a member of the old [[House Arviel]], though she despised this role and lived mostly at [[Putnam]] instead, a community south of [[Owohain]]. She broadly considers Putnam her true hometown.

Around the time of the [[War of the Masters]], Arviel enrolled at the [[Fifth Institute]] in a later self-admitted attempt to evade existing drafting measures. However, here Arviel found a new place, and contributed to much of the earliest study of [[Perícopa Doce]], after the Shahin redefinition was first published.

Some years after [[Zero Day]] occurred, Putnam was one of a number of communities subject to severe extrajudicial [[Witchcraft|witch]]-hunts, borne of [[new magic|neophobic]] sentiment. Arviel planned to return to the homestead, but before she could, the whole of the community was utterly destroyed in a handful of days, though it remains unknown by the general public if it was by the witch-hunters or some greater force.

Arviel, theorized to be guilty for her survival, adopted what she could of the younger human and gnomish survivors of the destruction, and spent time away from academia to raise her children and make smaller intrigues into new magic. 

Eventually, though, in [[1269 PT]], Arviel returned to the Institute as a High Manteian, filling a slot left vacant for over 15 years following the [[Great Hurricane]].

# Abilities
Rare in her current position, Arviel is not a [[Broadcaster]]. However, instead of natural talent in new magic, she is much more experienced as a summoner than most who currently claim that title, complete with an [[origo]] she claims is a piece of her family.
