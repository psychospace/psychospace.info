A **starfall**, or **day**, is a period of [[time]] which cycles when [[Cien]] descends below the horizon in a particular area of [[the Planet]]. This causes [[Lex|the]] [[Ordo|moons]] to rise in turn and unveil the [[Dark Sea]], leading to **night**, setting the stage for Cien to eventually rise again on the other side of the sky. 

Even before the institution of [[Pinwheel Tempo]], days and nights were widely used, both biologically and sociologically, to mark the passage of time. Day is also a term used more loosely, to describe an age or epoch.

Starfalls are generally divided into 8 *[[Watch (unit)|watches]]*, or 24 [[hours]] depending on culture. Each [[Month (unit)|month]] [[Pinwheel Tempo]] is comprised of thirty days. 

# Timezones
Even though, depending on your location in [[The Heavens]], the [[Star|Star]] may rise and set at differing intervals, [[Wizardry|wizards]] train themselves to synchronize the calculation of time according to the fall of the star over [[Pinwheel]], since it is also what determines the beginning and end of years. Due to the effects of the [[Dustwall]], [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] synchronizes its timescale with [[Umazia]] for most purposes.
