**The Beastlands** are the [[Flipside]] of [[Low Sacred]].

Occupied by nature in its most pure state, the Beastlands serves as a home for many creatures of natural and unnatural shapes and sizes, though its geography often defies definition. Higher and lower layers of the forest sometimes seem indistinguishable from each other. Heavily under the influence of [[Fey]] such as [[hag|hags]], the Beastlands are one of the most pure centers of natural [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]] that remains in the Heavens.

Many strange animals, such as [[Scribe moth|scribe moths]], dwell in the Beastlands.
