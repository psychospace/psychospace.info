![[⎋ Needs Expansion]]
**Julia Gutierrez** is a [[Elf#Half-elf|half-elf]] [[wildwalker]] from [[Ziegfeld Station]], and an editor working for the [[Daily Grind]]. An [[Apeirism|apeirist]], she enjoys studying the wildlife of the [[Upper Kernwelt]]. Her face has the scars of a life of hard-labor, long days in the sun... and probably fighting.

In [[1249 PT]], Julia was in her late-twenties. After hearing of the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]] from [[TRUE NAME (12-242)|TRUE NAME]], who was aiding [[Valerie Stout]] (a housemate), she offered 3000 [[Gold piece|gp]] for anybody who could bring her physical proof of the [[The Pitcher|pallid stranger]], advertising this through the *Grind*.
