The **Aykerr wizent** is a species of [bison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison), endemic to [[Bullion]]. They are notably capable of channeling [[Psion|psychic]] abilities, typically telekinesis, through using their horns as a focus. They earn their name from the [[Aykerr Valley]], a minor valley off-shoot from the [[Ithika River Valley]], where the wizent was first identified as unique from other bison. ^181ceb

The species gradually evolved into developing this defense, creating a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] "herdmind", for protection from predators. Wizent can coordinate noiselessly and instantly between herd mates, and share cognitive load of thought processes and herd decision-making. This makes them surprisingly robust fighters.

Aykerr wizent are ranched throughout Bullion, and animal products owed to them include their meat for food, hide for armor, and their distinctive horns for sinew used in wands and staves. Despite their penchant for accessing [[magic]] effects, they are not particularly intelligent or wise animals. The species has been around and relevant for centuries, but its natural population has been severely reduced and threatened by [overexploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overexploitation) and modern inventions in magic.
