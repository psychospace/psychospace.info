In the time of [[Ith'Paraan]] there existed the cultural concept of **reclamation**, a way of allowing criminals and lower-class individuals to accrue some renown through deeds committed in the name of greater goods. 

On one hand you might end up a privateer, or test pilot, or similar dangerous tasks. On the other hand you have essentially the most messed up interpretation of organ transplants, in the form of automata like [[Witness|witnesses]]. Ith'Paraan was highly classist and definitely racially segregated, but culturally (especially in preservation) their society owed a lot to the work of reclaimers. 

The word "reclaimer" in [[the Shibboleth]] today, and in their allies abroad in the [[Mer de Vide]], means similar amounts of rehabilitation for criminals, a kind of way of paying back debts you incur to society through more lucrative work (and less blatant classism).
