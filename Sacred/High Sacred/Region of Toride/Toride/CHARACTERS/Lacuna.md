**Lacuna** is a [[Visitant]] of [[Lazuli Dino|Linnaeus]].

Crafted from the prince's sense of humanitarian tendencies, they were [[Ikabod Caruso]]'s third creation for the purpose of curing the [[Dragonic Curse]], deemed a failure.  During [[Red Spark]], their unconscious body fled the [[Ivan's Tiger|Ivan's Tiger]] and traveled, at random, to [[Toride]].

There, Lacuna took their name and became an apprentice of [[Phalanx]], learning about the ways of fighting and [[alchemy]] from them in order to protect the people there from Nortian incursion.

Lacuna believed a chemical cure for the prince's curse existed. He was willing to come with the [[S4]] after discussing with [[Lethal]]: justice should be brought to his family, and he should be there to protect them when danger strikes.
