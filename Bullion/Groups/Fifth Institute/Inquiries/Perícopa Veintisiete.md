**[[Perícopa]] Veintisiete** (P5-27) is the sum-total inquiry of the [[Fifth Institute]] into [[new magic]], and the [[New God Phenomenon]] in specific. Beginning in late [[1250 PT]] after extensive research by [[Valerie Stout]] -- into [[the Pitcher]] and the vanishing of [[skitball]] during the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]] -- Perícopa Veintisiete seeks to investigate the appearance of [[new god|new gods]], [[Fulcrum|fulcrums]], and yet more lesions in reality which may bring about greater consequences for the world, such as [[Collapse state|collapse states]].

It was the opening of P5-27, through an in-depth account that constituted the Pitcher's known existence, that led to Stout's meteoric rise to fame within the bureaucracy of the Institute.

Veintisiete goes hand in hand with [[Perícopa Doce]] as some of the most depthful research conducted by the Institute in its years of existence.
