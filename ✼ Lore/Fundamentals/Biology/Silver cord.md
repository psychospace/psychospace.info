The **silver cord**, sometimes called the **astral chain**, is a mechanic of [[Manifold Seas]] which binds denizens of the [[Plane#Realm|realms]], such as [[Creature|creatures]], to their [[Body|bodies]] of origin, if ever they stray from their level of existence. It can be said to connect body to [[soul]], representative of the self-[[Soul bond|bond]] which keeps all the pieces of a soul together. 

It pseudo-physically appears as a literal rope or cord of indeterminable silvery color, formed out of [[Vitality energy|positive energy]], which extends from the back (vanishing into the distance), hence the name. 

If the cord is ever snipped by a powerful magic, any natural connection they had to their home physicality will be lost, and they will be unable to return home. In almost all cases, this results in [[Death|death]].
