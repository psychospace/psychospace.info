**Occultation** is an immense mysterious [[Magic|magic]] power sourced of the [[elseworld]], created only when a [[Divinity|god]]'s emotions and grudges linger and metastasize into a [[curse]]. It is said to have first come into existence when [[Arizhmiya]] [[Breaking of Sacred|betrayed the gods]].

It is said to be capable of evoking the aspect of stagnation so potently and fervently that its very use can stop the progress of future events, as was indicated by the [[Dragonic Curse|dragonic curse]] taking over the mind and seizing any future potential for it. 

For this reason, it was sought out by the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], as their leader sought a method of halting the [[End Times]].
