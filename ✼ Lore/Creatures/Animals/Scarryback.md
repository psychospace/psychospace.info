**Scarryback** beetles are ten-legged giant beetles, capable of being used as a beast of burden. It uses either four or six of its double-jointed legs to hold its prey or cargo steady, and the rest of its legs to move about. 

The most common species, called the "Common Scarryback", has a distinctive star-shaped horn, and was first discovered and raised in [[Scarred Sacred]].

Many are raised in the hills around [[Midzone]].
