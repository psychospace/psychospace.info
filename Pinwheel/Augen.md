Ioki'iyaka^[[[Neptunian]] for "Prince of All"] **Augen**, Praetor of [[Blure]], is a [[Pinwheel|Pinwheeler]] [[kitsune]] who acts as the ceremonial praetor of the [[Ioyon Dynasty of Gears]]. Augen is the oldest living kitsune, and likely the oldest living person in the entire [[Mer de Vide]], at nearly 3200 years old. 

Originally, Augen was an imperator, a ruler of Pinwheel, but this role has been ceded by them. As Augen helped to found the tradition of [[Pinwheel Tempo]], [[Augenschein]] is named for him and his yearly ritual.
