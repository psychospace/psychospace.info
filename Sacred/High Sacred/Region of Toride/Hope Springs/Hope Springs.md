**Hope Springs** is a city in [[High Sacred]].

Water falls from the large lake here, in an endless natural cycle caused by the temple at the lake's center creating a [[Phantasm]] that loops water in and out constantly. This water circulation gives the town its name, as "hope springs eternal" is surely what one would say about it.
