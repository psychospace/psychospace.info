Maedil Rysae was a powerful [[Enchantment|enchantress]] who was once wife to [[Ithuriel Rysae|Ithuriel]]. Her works are now worshipped as national treasures, and she has become revered as a [[Divinity|divine]] motherly icon, the [[Witchcraft|Witch]] of the Cosmos: and her brother [[Aedil Rysae|Aedil]], the Witch of the Skies. 

It is said Maedil possessed power over the stars, and thus over the destiny of all creatures, able to clear this land of its curse with Ithurielâ€™s assistance. She likely possessed some manner of the [[Gift of Stars|Gift]]. It was in her name that the [[Coven of the Night]] was originally founded.

The [[Maedil Plains]] are named for her.
