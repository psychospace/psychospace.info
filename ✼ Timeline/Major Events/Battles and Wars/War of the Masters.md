The **War of the Masters** as it was called was fought over control over the [[Colossal Ocean]], a massive area containing many small, island-like remnants while surrounded by mostly sky and odd weather phenomenons, like whirlpools of air. The War was fought between the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], under King [[Hadro Dino]] known as the Goodfather, and the Divine Republic of [[Dawndust]], under Supreme Pontiff [[Eis Meticast Andar-in]].

It lasted from [[1166 PT]] to [[1216 PT]].

# Combatants
On Sacred's side was the [[Great Nortian Empire]], specifically the forces of one of their two remnants, [[Yofora]], under Empress [[Bianca Nortia]]. Also allied with the Kingdom was the bolyar [[Kamikatsu Fukushiza]]-dono.

On Dawndust's side, aside from faith and righteousness, was the forces of the export-heavy [[Bullion]] under her [[The Shibboleth|Shibboleth]], overseen by Lord President [[Gurvig Ursyna]]. Also allied was the forces of [[Pinwheel]] under [[Xenian]] the Observer.
# History

About 5 years before the war, civil wars broke out between [[Orenvia]] and Dawndust, as the latter were attempting to convert the faith and recontextualize knowledge of oral traditions that had existed on the island since the [[The Gathering|Age of the Gods]]. 

It began in [[1166 PT]].

During this time, Sacred's own efforts in the region were escalated, discovering [[Wraithsword|weapons]] deep within the core of each island. Sacred and Nortia, seeking these opportunities to research these "wraith weapons", aided the people of Orenvia in beating back Dawndust's sphere of control, which led to war once other powers were involved. In the end it became a land-grab, hence why it lasted in force for so long and led to conflict on multiple shores (including battles in north Sacred, near [[Triptych]]).

In the summer of [[1216 PT]], when [[Critical Hit]] broke open the [[Vault of Foretelling]], transferring half their spoils back to the Kingdom as a peace offering. The Kingdom used these funds to create a working peace treaty (being as the other option was utter obliteration for one side or the other) and effectively convinced the parties of the conflict to sort themselves out and end the ceaseless madness.

## Aftermath
Following the war, Nortia's finances were unknown to Sacred but dwindling, and the empire's leadership did not reach out over time. It was known that many people fled Nortia in the ensuing time since then, for varying reasons. Archipel, while never fully united, eventually was annexed by Bullion. Both Dawndust and Pinwheel reformed their governments after a revolutionary cycle. Pinwheel now operates under the **Ioyon Dynasty**, and Dawndust operates under the still-forming state known as **Novo Shindan** based on ancient texts and other civilizations coming before it.

# Name

The War of the Masters was named for it was fought and planned by magicians on both sides, and those who pulled a wraith weapon from the ground and lived (as removing them was known to cause great destruction to the island) were called the "*master*" of the island. Over time this mythological title was abandoned as it came to be synonymous with the conquerors on both ends of the conflict.
