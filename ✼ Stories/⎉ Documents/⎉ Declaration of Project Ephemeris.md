People of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]]. Your [[Velocis Dino|queen]] addresses you. Blessed new year be upon you.

I prithee, as I deliver these words unto you, panic not. Remain thy soul calm. But the world has shifted, and nothing is availed by hiding the truth. This message is not to panic you, but to avoid panic. 

The times are new again with the rising of this new year. I will not lie to you. Our immediate forces are routed. 

[[Red Spark|A battle]] has befallen [[Drastic]], and betrayed our very peace. In the chaos, [[Linnaeus Dino|the Prince]]… my son… was kidnapped, all to do with a [[Dragonic Curse|curse]] that threatens to destroy him. [[Ildy]], eidolon guardian, is dead as well. Damage to nearly every building in the city, and countless dead weigh upon my mind and soul as I look now to the future. I had failed. Failed utterly in defending you all, as your knight. For this, I will avenge you.

The moment of danger has approached and entangled us in a [[Dragonic War|game]] greater than ourselves, in a plot to destroy the very soul of this nation. Our Victory Eternal. My son. The guardian of our capitol. All stolen from us. All must be repaid.

Repent the past; our mistakes are our own. And yet, we must set fire to the future, to warm ourselves by its embers.

This time is dire. This time is cold. It is the works of the [[Great Nortian Empire|Empire of Nortia]], serruptitious in their methods, swift in aggression, and untimely in extreme recourse: that is the basis of this time.

I will not lie to you. The Siege of Drastic has left little to the imagination as to the intentions of our enemy. With this proclamation, in the name of peace and prosperity, and in the name of the Prince Linnaeus whom has been ravaged, the Kingdom of Sacred sees no option aside from a declaration of war on the Empire of Nortia.

People of Sacred, the moment is dire, but not without hope. The Kingdom will survive if even an ember of hope survives in the hearts of our countrymen. The cause is here. The moment is nigh. 

Adventurers, soldiers, knights, guards — each and everyone of the hundreds who seek our common goals, mistake not what I say: When allies fall on the blades we trusted our lives to, the world is at stake. The time now to come together.

For Sacred, this is no mere battle. This year, we fight to defend our very way of life.

I wish you all the best of luck. Remain calm, and keep a steady hand and a high head. In the coming days we shall begin to prepare ourselves for the worse that, I fear, is yet to come. The efforts shall come to each of the official branches in time, along with this missive. This operation of ours shall heretofore be named Ephemeris: the guidance of our wayward stars to light the way to our victory.

But for now, we must stand together and hold fast.

And to any who have betrayed this Kingdom, and have approached the truth of this: if you are found guilty, nothing shall stem the tide of my wrath.

Hear it spoken aloud. **This war shall end, one day soon.**

Repent and set fire.
