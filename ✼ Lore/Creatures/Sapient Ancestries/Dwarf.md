**Dwarves**, known in their own language as the **t'inha duer**, are a hardy and widespread #sapient race of long-lived, short-heighted folk which have a stone-tough body composition and a general disposition for nature and community. A group of dwarves is known as a **court**. 

# Origins

Dwarves are said to have arisen from primeval [[Dragon|dragons]] which dwelled on the moons of [[Lex]] and [[Ordo]]. The [[Folly of the Twins]] produced two races, dwarves and [[goblin|goblins]].
# Traits

Dwarves treat their bodies like works of art or machines, things to be improved and evolved throughout their many years. A culture of hard work, ingenuity with molding the elements of the world, and dedication to spiritual immortality has led to many dwarves seeking treasure and renown to call their own, sometimes to the fault of their morality regarding non-dwarves. 

Their ties to primeval dragons, said to be born of the earth and the sky, as well as cultural ties to [[Elemental energy]], are why they have become predisposed to metalwork or mining, capable of surviving areas lacking in oxygen and which might unnerve a [[Human]] or [[Elf]].

Owing to their strong familial clan structures, many dwarves similarly treat their community or teams as integral parts of themselves, and feel that joining new cliques or leaving behind previous ones can be difficult.  Many dwarves happily share their resources with one another as a show of kinship.

On the other hand, for traditional dwarves, craftsmanship and ownership go hand-in-hand, and selling a dwarven-made artifact is essentially lending it out. Dwarves know full well all things eventually must meet their fate in nature at some point in their [[Epitome|epitomes]]. When [[antique|antiques]] meet such a fate, or when their lore is transformed over the eons, dwarves venerate and trust in the [[kami]], the new spirits which spring forth from the flows of the elements, acting as blessings from the Planet herself. 

# Heritages
Most dwarves are either **duer'doran** (mountain dwarves) or **duer'gola** (hill dwarves).
## Duergar
Descendants of a unusual legacy, **t'inha duer'gar**, sometimes called **dark dwarves**, are dwarves who have turned apparently monstrous through abandoning their guardian deities to remain deep underground. 

Their skin has an unusual likeness to stone. Their societies often cooperate with or leading many other groundbound folk towards leading conflict against the surface world, a fact which suits their desire to protect ancient ruined sites. They are often credited with creating many unusually placed [[Phantasm|phantasms]] or odd machines, as, like many creatures which came about during the Gathering, many possess powerful minds.

## The Gray Sect
When [[The Gathering]] occurred, the [[Calamity of the Eyes|theft of insight]] was followed shortly thereafter by a seduction of dwarvenkind by [[Imagi]] in the form of a simple, genetic plea: "*Do not forget where you came from.*" Imagi supposedly delivered this message to drive distinctly brainy prey back underground, where the now-trapped [[Illithid|illithids]] had been pushed, especially in a time when those civilizations were gradually expanding aboveground.

A contingent of dwarves were particularly receptive to this command with absolute blood-soaked fervor, driving their siblings who did not believe in this cry aboveground, and protecting, without equivocation, the ruins of the pre-Gathering civilizations, in spite of their decaying insight to understand it. This faith was said to be more important than anything else, even turning family members against one another. These dedicated few became the first duergar.
