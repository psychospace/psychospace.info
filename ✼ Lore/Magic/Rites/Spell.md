A **spell** is a specific tract of [[psychic code]] that results in [[magic]] being cast. The term specifically describes [[Compilation|compiled]] sequences of code. A spell has an [[Arcane complexity|arcane complexity]], and usually has a form of [[Tribute|Tribute]].

These sequences, be they miraculous or arcane, are often internalized by casters, who prepare them each day to be used and must re-prepare if a change is desired. 

Spells can be written down on [[Scroll|scrolls]], which allows other people to use them.

The effects of spells are low-level [[Reality-Bending|reality-bends]], but unlike the modern use of that phrase, the process of creating or utilizing a spell is designed to remain safe and often well-studied.
