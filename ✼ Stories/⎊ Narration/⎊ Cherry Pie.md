"I want to say something.<br>I don't quite know what..<br>It begins with 'thank you'.

From the depths of my heart, I... thank you,.<br>forever, and ever...<br>And that, that will be only the first.<br>of a hundred thousand gratitudes.<br>that will be heaped upon you.<br> in all the forms thanks might be granted..<br>

The past is behind us...<br>And our future is aflame, alighted with hope and uncertainty..<br>This age we live in, it is as my family's words have granted us.

Still, Exponen and Lagacia... That omen, and Nemain....<br>All the soldiers in emotional turmoil, on both sides....<br>The redshift of time is underway, just as the conspiracy had predicted...<br>You averted an unfathomable catastrophe in the process, and have saved all of us...<br>The future is on our doorsteps, and we are only to answer it...<br>Yet... that scratch on the sky is a source of still unimagined anxiety...<br>And because of that...

I'm not sure where to start...

My heart is heavier than it ever has been....<br>and my soul, sullied with pain that won't go away...<br>Ildy is gone,<br>but his voice,<br>the thought of seeing you all again.<br>the thought of seeing mom and dad again.<br>the thought of seeing everyone again....<br>the thought of making this pie...<br>that kept me going through everything.

And I kept fighting, because I knew that I could…<br>Even making no progress day by day, I wanted to fight…<br>Because he believed in me…<br>Because he gave his life for me...

Because of all that has been said and spent,<br>because of all that you have done,<br>my wounds can finally begin to close…

The future<br>is bright…<br>For all of us.

Arizhmiya... no, that wretched shadow dragon....<br>Despite wanting to avenge its creator, it... was blind.<br>It hated me so much, and it did not understand why.<br>It was a weapon, but it was a living being, too.<br>The power it wielded, the hate it felt, had lost all original context.<br>So when the curse was levied on us, it was given somewhere to go.<br>It wanted someone to listen to it.<br>It wanted someone to be it.<br>Someone it could make into itself, so it could speak again.<br>And it would tear everything apart if it were not heard.<br>It hurt so much that it hurt others.<br>I can only pity such a ruthless creature.

Regret, and pain.<br>An undying motive...

It tried to make me its shape… and I…<br>I had to hold out… so I could wait for you all.

Day in and day out, I weathered it.<br>The thoughts that intruded upon my mind…<br>
Told me that I couldn't, told me that I shouldn't…<br>told me that we'd be stronger together.<br>I had to shut them out.

And there were days where it won.<br>Days where the pain I've suffered… wasn't enough for it.<br>And days upon days<br>where my mind wasn't mine.<br>Where my dreams were only his.

And I had to live anyway. I had no way to take control.

But I had to be me…<br>and I had to make sure I could be me.<br>So that I could be here, again.<br>That I could be, again.

The moments where the [[Bianca Nortia|empress]] spoke to me were like water in a drought.<br>We both felt so lost.<br>But we had each other to ground ourselves.<br>So even when the shadows grew,<br>I knew there were lights out there in the darkness.

There were days where I listened to the wind.<br>Mostly, I heard aught but anger for thousands of years of pain.<br>But there were other voices I could hear, too.<br>Prayers for a return.<br>Prayers for understanding and healing.<br>Prayers for their own safety.<br>Prayers that [[visitant|sounded like mine]], but weren't.

Those voices guided me to the church. Helped me recover myself.<br>Those voices reawakened what Ildy had meant to me.<br>Somehow I knew... that you were behind that.<br>And now I have... more family than I could imagine.<br>And they're out there growing up. Being people.<br>Offered the chance. Offered a future.<br>Amid ruin. <br>Amid chances stolen left and right.<br>Amid meaningless loss.

The scars of war wracking our homes,<br>scars of being turned inside out,<br>I only hope one day heal as I have.

I got to go home, again,<br>and I'll never have to feel hurt again<br>for who I am in my bones.

I realized something as part of my original tour around the countryside with you all.<br>It was something I recognized in myself, a discomfort.<br>Were it not for all of this, it would have been our little New Year's secret.<br>But now... after everything, after all this trouble, I suppose I should just come forward and say it.

I am NOT... a prince. Not... at heart. Not a man.<br>That may be who I am today, but it's not who I am in here. In truth. Where it counts.<br>These transformations I've gone through,<br>let alone my soul siblings' variety of appearances,<br>have only further set that notion in stone.<br>I am... not sure of many things, about my personal identity.<br>And I'll probably stumble, on the road to understanding.

And now, I get to decide who I am. Just as my soul siblings have.<br>The voice in my head is just me, now. Which makes me free to choose who that is.

But I know deep in my heart, that whoever I am, <br>I know I want to save the world.<br>
I want to tell our story.<br>I'm a hero at heart. And I must help the people.<br>Call it... recompense, for the trouble I've put everyone through.<br>That's my victory, my hope, that I can provide to others.

I am starting where I can start.<br>I'm out there every day, doing what I can<br>for whoever I can find.<br>Whatever they need, I want to make happen.<br>Fighting to move forward.<br>Fighting to stamp out tyranny.<br>Fighting for the future.<br>Becoming someone my mom will be proud of.

And still, now I recognize that...<br>The picture lodged in my skull of that wretched dragon<br>is gone<br>no longer tugging at my sleeve,<br>no longer burning my mind:<br>for good, now.

When I was young, and the curse was explained to me, I spoke with Ildy.<br>I told Ildy that <br>the day I was finally cured,<br>The day I was better, <br>The day I was okay,<br>would be the day I would bake a pie for everyone in the castle.

Today is the day, Ildy.<br>Today is the first day of the rest of my life.<br>I'm finally there.

It's cherry. Your favorite flavor.<br>I'm sorry you're not here to enjoy it.<br>But it's okay. I'm okay.<br>You and I did all we could.<br>You can rest knowing that.

Through whatever we face in the future, that fact won't change.<br>I am alive. I am myself. Thanks to all of you.<br>And though tomorrow may come, and bid us farewell again, I will never forget this moment.

You are all, and forever will be, my heroes."
