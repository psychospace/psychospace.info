The **Research Protectorate of Winifreyad** is a relatively wealthy-yet-small state overseen by the Keepers of the [[Fifth Institute]], and in-turn a de facto shared territory of [[The Shibboleth]].

This territory, historically named **Reyezuela** for its gold-tinged mountains, is largely comprised of the most proximal impact zone of a colossal ancient meteorite, the [[Os'Grun]]: or, at least, the most intact ruins of that time, as well as pre-[[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] events (so pre-mythic). The landscape is a lot of chaotic rises and falls held in on most sides by tundra as a direct result, and was not inhabited except by nomadic tribes for a long while.

The region has been a research protectorate for most of modern history, though more recently, in the past two centuries, it has formed a vital organ of the Shib, especially through [[Karyos]], its capital city. It is named after a famous [[Winfrið Kollen|emira]] of [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qaulhain]]. It’s colloquially called “Ol’ Winnie”.

Its demonym is "*winifreyano*" in [[Mänyya|Elvish]] and "Freyite" in [[Shindani]].
