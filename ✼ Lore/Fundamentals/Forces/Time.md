**Time** is the [continued sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time) of existence and events from the past to the future. Time in [[The Heavens|the Heavens]] is a [[Logic|logical]] fundamental force of [[magic]], expended consistently as [[Tribute]], which is interrelated with [[Light (property)|Light]].

The standard by which time is often intercalated in the Heavens is [[Pinwheel Tempo]]. Time determines the order of [[âœ¼ Timeline Hub|history]].

In extremely rare, possibly pseudoscientific cases, creatures have demonstrated the potential to [[time travel]].
