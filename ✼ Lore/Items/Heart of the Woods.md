This crystalline heart-like structure exudes a powerful psychic field that extends around the entire area known as the [[Giant Forest]], keeping the entire region in a state of parity with the wild strangeness of [[the Beastlands]], which defends the Heart and keeps the forest relatively secluded and safe from the surrounding countryside.

It grew from the roots of the [[Tree of Time]], and formed its own barrier in the [[Father Sakura]]. It is also called the "Sakura's heart".

It has a will of its own. To destroy the heart is improbable. However, it is corruptible.
