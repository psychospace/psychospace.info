In [[magic]], **infusion** is the study of creating **[[Magic|magical]] items**, objects which possess supernatural properties. In scholarly studies, it is a sub-study of the [[Classical Schools|Classical School]] of [[enchantment]], though it is practiced throughout the world within many contexts.

Infused objects, also called "enchanted items", are granted special purpose by their creators, and are used from everything from [[Filistec|warfare]] to [[scroll|research]] to [[core engine|travel]].

# History

According to the [[Second Institute]], the study of infusion was initially expounded from the [[Psionics|psionic]] study of the process of [[Antique|artifact]] generation. Over time, such objects become infused with so much [[Psychic code|code]] and [[Echo|data]] that their physical shape or natural properties change, and they eventually take on "[[Spell|spells]]" all their own.

In modernity, conventionally-created magic items are created through an artificialized version of this process. The items are initially enchanted by suggestive spells, shaping the item, granting it aspects it would never have otherwise.
