**Serratura "Serra" Neeman** is a 20-year old [[Elf#Half-elf|half-elf]] rogue who specializes in insight and investigation. Hailing from the area of [[the Beastlands]] known as [[The Whiskerwood]], Serra is twins with [[Chiave Neeman]], both children of [[Roff Neeman|Roff]] and [[Lianne Neeman]]. 

She has been an indispensable and consistent member of the adventuring group known as the [[S4]] since it was founded.

# History
Once, [[Slinky]] got loose in the Whiskerwood as a result of Serratura's actions, leading to a significant bout of guilt. Also once, [[Open-Skies Free Bird]], a traveler from the village, returned with a book by [[Beverly Hamandegs]] which inspired Serra's longtime obsession with the [[Ashton Orpheus Albatros|Ace of Gold]].

At the time of [[1250 PT]], she and Chiave were 20 years old. Having a strong sense of initiative, the two sought the quest from the prince [[Linnaeus Dino|Linnaeus]] in order to investigate the weird goings-on, as other [[Phantasm|phantasms]] into [[the Beastlands]] were failing for reasons unknown. She became a longtime member of the [[S4]] as a direct result, continually seeking the truth.
## Current Affairs
During the [[Miraclesfield Experiment]], she was entrapped by [[Phantasma Goria]] in the [[Ghost storm]]. She was later bailed out by the [[Cat Lord]], sending her to [[Whitecrow]] where she met [[Lithop]]. After the S4 took back [[Yaarda Fort]], she linked back up with them, using the time to introspect.

Serratura is currently on the mission to Nortia in order to stop the [[Nortian Conspiracy]].
# Personality
Amongst her friends, Serratura is widely described as plucky, almost to a fault. She is a prankster, a fact which endears fellow teammate [[Arthur Graywell|Arthur]] to her to no end, and she holds great respect for many people. She often rambles, a fact which accentuates her often insightful and unique perspective on many scenarios she's encountered. However, she is not one for conflict, and has some traumatizing memories of being confronted by people who she thought liked her and could trust her.

When fighting an enemy, Serra's style is best described as "lithe" and lethal, though this does not stop her from occasionally cracking jokes and the like.

# Appearance
Serratura is a half-elf with cat-like features, including nocturnal sight which resembles a cat's reflective eyes. She is relatively middling height for her ancestry and age, and resembles her twin Chiave in extremely obvious ways. She has hazel eyes. As a result of the Miraclesfield experiment, her arms are marked by silvery stripes, a form of scar as a boon.
