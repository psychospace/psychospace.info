Much like the real-world, **water** is a [substance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water) which plays a vital role in all [[Creature|living things]], as well as turned to vapor in [[Cloudscape|clouds]]. Within [[the Heavens]], water is an [[elemental energy]], associated with peace, mystery, flow, and perpetuity.

Magically, water is a force of defined [[chaos]], forming one of the four fundamental axioms of nature, along with [[fire]], [[air]], and [[earth]]. The [[Plane#Realm|realm]] of water for [[the Planet]], where its most potent power lies, is known to be the [[Dark Sea]].

Water allows for all life and rebirth, and not one mortal can survive for long without access to some form of water. Aquatic creatures dwell in some source of water. The sapient races of the Planet have long controlled various elements of water with industry, such as through locks or dams, or with [[magic]], as core [[tribute]] for creating [[figment|figments]].

It flows through the remnants in a perpetual water cycle, beginning with sources like rivers, lakes, and waterseas, and beginning anew as part of the [[weather]]. Its fusion with [[air]] forms the basis of [[wood]].
