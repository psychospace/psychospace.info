A **survival mantle** is a piece of magical armor. The methods to crafting it, originally intended to service sailors or conquerors of the [[Dark Sea]], is a well-guarded [[Illithid]] secret, though apparently [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] [[starchitects]] constructed something similar.

This carapace-like augmentation encases portions of the wearer's shoulders, neck, and chest. A survival mantle is equivalent to a suit of nonmagical half plate armor and takes just as long to don or doff. It can't be worn with other kinds of armor.

A creature wearing a survival mantle can breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum) and has improved constitution against harmful gases.
