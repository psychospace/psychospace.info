![[⎊ Golorr Bares All#^93dce2]]

**Golorr** is an [[Aboleth|aboleth]] which was contained in a stone by the [[Carapa Republic]] primarily to be a record-keeper of history, and secondarily in order to act as a piece of their Contingency. It was freed by the [[S4]].
# History
Golorr was spawned in the [[Vault of Foreknowledge|pooled waters]] beneath [[Stygian]], planted there at the dawn of the [[Old world|new world]]. Golorr witnessed the birth of [[Arizhmiya|Lagacia]].

Eventually, when the prison was built over top of it by the [[Angel|angels]], Golorr fled the pool into the [[Grand Watersea]] where it, as with its kin, would exert a will over the [[First Magicians]]. Eventually, though, the forces of the [[Welkin]] would stamp out such efforts. In this depowered state, it witnessed the [[Breaking of Sacred]], and the creation of [[Arahabaki]]. 

## Tenure as a stone
Thousands of years afterwards, the hardy Golorr would eventually be bound in an emerald [[soulstone]] by [[St. Bithynia]] using [[Marmarancy]]. Here, it became the full cataloguer of the histories of the Carapaeans. When the invasion of [[Plesio Falknjir]] threatened their sovereignty, Golorr was told of the nature of the [[Vault of Foretelling|Vaults of Foretelling]] and [[Vault of Foreknowledge|Foreknowledge]], as well as the means of stopping the [[Dragonic Curse]] when time came to reinstate the dynasty.

Sequestered and passing hands between noble treasure hunters for hundreds of years, Golorr would continue to observe, in secret, the progression of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], cataloguing in silence all major events to follow. 

The stone was eventually found by [[Critical Hit]], where, after much difficulty and trading hands from faction to faction, it was used to unlock the Vault of Foretelling. After the party brokered a deal with the Kingdom, the Stone of Golorr was physically divided amongst Critical Hit's membership by [[Ikabod Caruso]], to keep the vault secure in case its severe protection was ever needed again. [[Sekkan-shin]], a tangential ally of Critical Hit, was also told of the artifact's history.

When the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]] occurred, Sekkan-shin formulated a plan to recombine Critical Hit to reconstitute the stone, in an attempt to end [[Dragonic War|the nascent war]]. This was in service of asking the aboleth for secret knowledge that it was forced to hold back: a task the dragon gave to the [[S4]].

Though it took some time, the stone was eventually completed (and recombined by Caruso), and Golorr was freed. After delivering the information, Golorr fled the scene to places unknown.
