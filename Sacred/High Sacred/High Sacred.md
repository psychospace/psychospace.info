**High Sacred**, historically known as **Carapa**, is a [[Remnant]], technically one half of a single remnant shattered by the [[Breaking of Sacred]]. Its [[Flipside|Flipside]] is [[Mount Celestia]]. Its counterpart is [[Low Sacred]]. The many unique features of the remnant offer many boons to its people.

The [[Kingdom of Sacred]] rules here.

High Sacred is split into three duchies:
- **Grander**, headquartered in [[Miraclesfield]]
- [[Drastic]], headquartered in the city of the same name
- [[Toride]], headquartered in the city of the same name

It also is bordered by the [[Queen's Isle]] to the northwest.
