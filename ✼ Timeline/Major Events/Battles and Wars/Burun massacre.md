On [[1251 PT#3-4-1251|3-4-1251]] PT, a **massacre** occurred at a hidden [[Heartknock]] facility underneath [[Arklay Manor]] on the outskirts of the city of [[Burun]].

The massacre was perpetrated by [[Amanita Parasom]], after her sister and shadow, [[Octavia Parasom]], was taken hostage by [[XO]], as potential leverage and to ground the twins. 

# Event
Amanita exploited their potent [[soul bond]] to [[portal|manifest]] behind the assassin, shooting it dead with her [[Illarion Parasom|late father]]'s [[firearm|handdragon]]. She proceeded to clear the room over the course of approximately 80 seconds. Amanita took two shots herself, one in the left arm and the other grazing her torso, from [[Zizz]] and [[Blister]] respectively. The first shot taken apparently prevented Octavia from being executed.

In total, six of the then-decomposing [[Nortian Conspiracy]] were killed -- XO, and all remaining members of [[Special Task Force Undergarden|STFU]]. The twins themselves went missing shortly afterwards, exiling themselves to the [[First City]].

The massacre was discovered a short time later by imperial inquisitors under [[Serena Nortia|Serena]]'s guidance.

# Location
The location was codenamed **[[Project KC|KC]]-SIGMA**. Located underneath Arklay Manor, the facility was a factory-lab once used by the Arklay noble family of wizards, rebuilt and modernized by civil engineers (through a cutout) to construct [[Shiny Mask|shiny masks]] among other paraphernalia for the Heartknock.

On [[1250 PT#10-21-1250|10-21-1250]], KC-SIGMA was visited by [[Serena Nortia]] while investigating what she would later discover to be the Conspiracy. It was a copy of *[[Visage of the Fortress]]* which she found there that led to her realizing that her [[Bianca Nortia|mother]]'s soul was unreachable, locked away by an [[Scarla Nitrum|unknown darkness]].
