A **fish** is an aeronautic gill-bearing animal that lacks limbs with digits. Fish are axiomatically drawn to the [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]] of [[air]] and [[water]]. 

Generally, they are ectothermic, and dwell within the [[Cloudscape|cloudscapes]] of [[The Heavens]]. They are differentiated from [[bird|birds]], who nest on land; fish are abundant in and nest in clouds and other sources of water.

Their gills are capable of drawing useful oxygen out of areas of thinned oxygen, for example most [[Skysea|skyseas]], allowing them to breathe in environments other animals find difficult.

Port towns generally have fishing operations: either waterfish or skyfish, differentiated by their source. The deeper towards [[The Below]] one goes, and the higher one goes towards or beyond [[The Above]], the more varied the fish one will find.
