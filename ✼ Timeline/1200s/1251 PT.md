## Ersta (1)
### 1-1-1251
* Queen [[Velocis Dino]] [[⎉ Declaration of Project Ephemeris|announces]] [[Project Ephemeris]]. The strange cat that [[Serratura Neeman|Serratura]] took to [[Castle Xilan]] is revealed to be [[Concordia]], a servant of [[Sharkbite Bluff]] who has been saved. Under the captaining of [[Star of the North]], the [[Red Diamond]] takes wing first to [[Somnia]], then to the [[Royal Bladeworks]][^22]. 
* On the way to Somnia, the party are attacked by [[Heartknock]] again[^23]. 
### 1-2-1251
Upon arrival at the Bladeworks late in the day, a moot is held by the higher ups of the [[Sacred Dragoon Force]] on a theoretical strategy to push the war forward in their favor[^24]. 
* Following the quest given to them by [[Sekkan-shin]], the party receive audience with [[Ridd of Chained-Earth]] (after proving themselves in [[Puretza]]'s [[The Sheer|Sheer]] arena[^25]) who informs them that Sekkan may not have been entirely forthcoming: when he said "Reunite [[Critical Hit]]", he was referencing the [[Golorr|Stone of Golorr]][^26]. 
* Star is convinced to stay behind and apprentice with Ridd, in order to understand the tie that [[Dinofang]] has to the prince: without her, the party recruits some of the many people outside the Bladeworks as a new crew for the Diamond[^27]. The party also takes their new name as the [[S4]].

The Red Diamond takes wing and sets out to return to [[Drastic]]. In the night, the party is attacked by the [[House of Horrors]], who curse [[Arthur Graywell|Arthur]] with lycanthropy. The proximity to [[Void energy|negative energy]] causes [[Lethal]] to react with an unusual dream[^28].

### 1-3-1251 
* In midday, the S4 touches down in Drastic once again. In front of the [[S4t|Beatific Keep]], a tree has been erected from the blossoming of the [[Phoenix Seed]]. [[Eldral Levin]] revives the figure trapped inside it, revealed to be [[Elain Valaransia]], an abandoned member of the Conspiracy[^29]. Elain propositions to take someone behind enemy lines, taking [[Volk Vendleberg]] with her as she teleports.  The [[Trickster's Children]] steal their ways into the Beatific Keep to obtain Elain and surreptitiously retrieve the [[Wand of Mythos]] from Arthur, who'd been holding onto it since [[Ildy]]'s death. When Elain vanishes, the children become sloppy and are discovered. In response, Arthur reacts with righteous anger and calls forth a T-rex to stop them, an act which gets him sent to the [[Union Keep]] by [[Hieron Dredge]][^30].
* At [[Dom Otdykha]], Volk and Elain arrive. However, Elain is already about to be replaced, as she was Ranked XIIIth and is no longer necessary. They are led by [[Hazel Sobol]] to the helm of the ship, where [[Wren Doggabone|the Wrench]] has Elain dragged off and Volk tortured by the [[Nine Lives Stealer]], a process which magically kills him. [[Serena Nortia]], close by, manages to use [[Monism]] to rescue Volk's soul, though at the cost of her leg.[^30a] Noting the oddity with Volk's soul lingering behind, his body is thrown in a jail cell for study.

### 1-4-1251
The party is forced to spend a day without two members, and Arthur learns in captivity that Volk was killed.[^31]

### 1-5-1251
Arthur is freed thanks to Hieron pulling strings. The party, seeking more pieces of the Stone, travels to the [[Oldwall Pub]], now ruined, where [[Chadley Korol]] is waiting with his retainers [[Nihiru Shizuka]], [[Lars Lohrsword]], and [[Ben Kaber]]. With the mighty captain's help, [[Lurana Moonswallow]] is freed from the [[Chahi Decade Reserve]][^32]. That night, Serratura dreams of [[Chiave Neeman|Chiave]]'s kidnapping from [[The Whiskerwood]], and the party receives even more reason to travel to Dom Otdykha[^33].

### 1-6-1251
The party learns that the Conspiracy plan to attack [[Port Fester]] in 5 days. With this in mind, the party begin their plan to subvert the attack and rescue their party members in one fell swoop. With Sekkan-shin in tow[^34], the S4 set out towards [[Barbiche]][^35].

%%???%%

### 1-10-1251 
Late into the night, the S4 siege Dom Otdykha, rescuing Volk and Chiave and severely damaging the installation.[^36]

### 1-11-1251
Just after midnight, the party returns to Barbiche, successful from their mission. The following day, the Conspiracy attack Port Fester, but are distracted by the effort made by the party and their attack is viciously unsuccessful. The same day, [[Frances Jayne]] is recruited by [[Hieron Dredge]] to assist the party in recruiting the [[Visitant|visitants]] created by Ikabod Caruso.[^37]

%%The events of sessions 38-42%%

### 1-25-1251
Seventh to Kalends — The crew of the Red Diamond go out for drinks at the [[Cracked Window Club]], and the S4 followed. However, late into the full moon night, he is ambushed by [[Rosewire Abatah]], transforming into a [[Primal curse#Weird-creatures|weirdwolf]]. Rosewire is killed, [[Vergoldeter Minutenzeiger Panikdrache|Minty]] swoops in to save the case, and Arthur remains stuck in morph a little while longer. [^43]

%%The events of sessions 44-46%%

### 1-30-1251
That night, Volk is bitten by Arthur.

# Wote (2)
### 2-1-1251
Volk is put on a new mission by the Trickster's Children, and departs the party early in the morning. 

%%Late session 47, 48, 49, and the start of session 50 take place.%%

The party meet [[Lyrica]]. The [[Miraclesfield Experiment]] takes place. [[Kingdle Fire]] and Serratura are caught up in the [[Ghost storm]]: Serra witnesses [[Phantasma Goria]]. 

### 2-2-1251
Volk is contacted by [[ELIZ]] to do investigating of a nearby quarry, a [[Rollingstone Mining Company]] project that was abandoned in [[1238 PT]]. In that quarry is a [[Runic engine#Faults|runic engine bomb]] that was set off in 1250 PT to produce the first purple storm. He is rained out by the ghost storm from Miraclesfield.

%%2-3-1251 ???%%


### 2-4-1251
Volk is no longer rained out; he travels across the [[Victory Canyon]], stopping at the ruins of the *[[Caged Bird]]*. After investigating for a while, he was dropped in on by [[Kingdle Coal]], and his blood surged, causing him to temporarily lose conscious thought.

### 2-5-1251
Volk awakens in the caves the morning after. Volk hunted for any evidence in the quarry, using his new coat to stand out in the rain freely, and discovered that the Heartknock was definitely here at some point, but found very little evidence of things being moved around. He backtracked to try and find the *Bird* again, but there was no sign nor clue of the ship having taken off or been dragged away: it just vanished.

%%Events of 51-63%%

### 2-19-1251
[[Shohei Integra]] reintroduces himself to the S4. That night, Kessah dreams of Hosuseri.[^63]

### 2-20-1251
[[Serena Nortia]] reveals herself to the S4[^63] and to the [[Kingdom of Sacred]][^64]. The combined forces of the party and Ikabod Caruso embark into [[Stygian]] for the [[Vault of Foreknowledge]], uncovering the truth of [[Arahabaki]]'s existence thanks to the reawakened [[Golorr]][^65]. After fighting off the Warden of Stygian[^66], the party traveled into the [[Vault of Foretelling]], bursting the lock and reawakening the sunken [[Aet'Caldwyn]]. Using the *[[Kymodokê]]*, and retrieving a suitable vessel in the form of [[Wings of the End]], the party set out for their new destination without further delay[^67].

### 2-21-1251
The party touches down on Aet'Caldwyn, meeting [[Lucid Sky]]. Using [[L'ipotesi|the slingshot]], the party enters the [[Cathedral of the Womb]] and retrieves the [[Invertebra]] from [[SUEANNIL]][^68]. With it in hand, the sky began to darken as the Conspiracy ambushed the party. The sudden threat caused Lucid Sky and [[Coursing Stream]] to malfunction[^69], though the party were able to knock them into sense again. Getting back aboard the *Kymodokê*, the party were further attacked by Hazel Sobol. Serena talks her down, and she reveals that she was commanded by [[Illarion Parasom]][^70] . The party returns to Drastic successfully, in part thanks to the unveiling of the SRF [[Full Velocity]][^71]. Most of the rest of the night is spent preparing the various groups of allies for the mission to nortia.

### 2-22-1251
[[Iosif Nortia]] is contacted by Serena. The S4 sets out aboard the [[Wings of Dawn]][^73], with Shohei, Ikabod, Eldral, and Star joining them.

### 2-24-1251
On their third day in the air, Serena attempts a supertransmission to [[Uforia]], and [[Discrepant#^182a4e|temporarily vanishes]]. 

Over the course of the intervening week, the S4 continue to hone their abilities in anticipation of the final battle.
