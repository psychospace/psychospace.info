The **Crest of Conception** is the [[Shindani]] name for an [[Arckan]] [[rune]] which symbolizes "creation", "birth", "invention", "[[soul]]", and "conception". It resembles a unicursal heart, followed by a tail which ends in a circular shape. 

It was initially pictured in old literature belonging to [[Logan Caruso]] from the [[Constellar School]], describing the "beating heart of the planes".

In modern times, it was used as an emblem of the [[Heartknock]], and was later etched into the very identity of [[the Planet]] through the [[sky-scrape]].
