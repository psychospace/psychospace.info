The Wing Quarter is [[Gateway]]'s northwestern quarter, is the **Wing Quarter**. This is where the hangar for landing and repairing airships is, and it is often crawling with guards due to the nature of commerce. Gateway, unlike [[The Well]], seems so overconfident in its own ability to protect the people that places where battles are had and wagers settled are free to operate as long as they don't publicly advertise as such. While nowhere near the level of ostentatiousness and coin trading hands as the Well, it certainly gives off the same vibe.
