**Red Sally** was a [[Dullahan]], a mythological [[Archipel|Archipelian]] captain of the vessel *Vast Distance*. 

She encountered her new nature after being beheaded by her own father for refusing an arranged marriage, and as accounts go, her anger alone at this recourse brought her back and transformed her into a vicious reborn pirate. 

During her time as the most prominent privateer on the skyseas, she would often conduct raids against dragons who tried to make footholds in Archipel through stealing entire hoards. After one battle, it is said, she lost her head entirely for days, before eventually finding it buried in a snowdrift.
