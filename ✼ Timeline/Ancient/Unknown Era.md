The so-called **Unknown Era** is an era of history which followed the [[War of Chaos]], and precipitated the [[Age of the Gods]].

During this missing era of history, the universe (and particularly the [[Antic Sea]]) apparently bounced back from the brink. The scant details reveal that the clash between the “truth” of civilization and the “ideals” of Maker formed a sort of bedrock upon which the “rules” of this universe began to take shape once again. It is said that certain artifacts, such as the [[Apocrypha of Winds]], took their present shape in this timeframe.
