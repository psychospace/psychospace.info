**Yondo**^[(YAWN - doh)]  is a company operating in [[Bullion]] which deals in [[Verlan|verlanic]] systems and components. They offer off-the-shelf and specialty/custom verlanic system sale and installation. Within their storefronts, they have relatively small quantities of verlanic parts and components targeted towards hobbyists for sale. Bulk orders are available through their catalog for large organizational demands. 
# Business
## System Installations
Yondo's main business is in the sale, delivery, and installment of verlanic systems mainly within buildings. Most orders are completed with one of their many pre-prepared systems that fit most projects. These include basic building amenities for various building sizes, [[Dust tunnel#Dust garden|dust generation]] and storage plants, and dust transference lines. 

More complicated or extra-large scale systems are also available through custom orders. Municipalities and organizations with large campuses are the main customers for custom orders.
## Bulk Component Sale
Organizations can bulk order verlanic supplies through Yondo as a supplier. These do not come with any installation service as it is assumed that the customer wishes to use the components on their own. 
## Storefront Sales
Hobbyists can walk into a Yondo storefront to purchase small quantities of lower-power and smaller verlanic components. 
### Locations
Yondo has storefronts in the following locations in Bullion:
- [[Owohain]] (NW)
- [[Castellan's Junction]]
- [[Arnecca]]
- [[Ithuriel's Landing]]
