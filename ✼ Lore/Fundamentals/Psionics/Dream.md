A **dream** is an experience or memory, sourced from [[psychospace]], which emerges during the natural processes of sleep. It can also be induced as part of **meditation**. It is the most typical way a non-[[Magic#Cast|caster]] will interact with the realm of the mind, and is apparently partially connected to the [[elseworld]]. 

An experiential space within the dream is known as a **dreamscape**; study and interpretation of dreams is known as **oneirology**. [[Rivenium]] is a material said to be the physical form of a dream.

# Effects
Typically synonymous with [[Echo|echoes]], dreams are often thought to be more abstractions of agglomerated echoes, as a "side-effect" of the [[soul]]'s nature and how it can form [[Soul bond|connections]]. The true purpose of dreaming is theorized to be a mechanic of how the mind catalogues and stows away memories for later.

Almost all [[magic]] can manipulate dreams, both directly and indirectly, as echoes of willpower form the basis of most [[off-wave|off-waves]]. A typical form of [[telepathy]] is [[Telepathy#Dream|oneiropathy]], transmitting feelings and thoughts through the dream space. 

Some creatures, particularly mentally- or spiritually-impressive ones such as [[Dragon#Umbral|umbral dragons]], have dreams so powerful that they can [[Reality-Bending|alter reality]] outside the dreamscape.
# Cultural

Because of its ubiquitous experience by almost any [[creature]], dreaming is one of the most discussed topics in [[psionics]] and culture in general: and according to the [[Apocrypha of Winds]], the practice even predates the [[War of Chaos]]. Creatures with high [[senzai]] have clearer, more vivid dreams. 

It is believed that many [[Divinity|divines]] convey their desires through dreams and meditation. Many cultures throughout the world place special importance on dreams, how they contemplate the worlds [[Out There]] and the inner worlds as well.
