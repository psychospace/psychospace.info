The **Breaking of Sacred**, also known as the **trespass of [[Arizhmiya]]**, was an important event which occurred in around 500,000 BPT. It marked the end of the [[Age of the Gods]].


# History
When [[Exponen]] never "arose" to challenge it, [[Arizhmiya|Lagacia]] became increasingly idle and gave itself busywork. Eventually, its boredom became so much that it began to play with people, attempting to cause them to reject [[Exponen]]'s teachings of freedom and exploration, attempting to weave their way into direct intervention on mortal minds. 

In order to break stagnation, it shunted its divine soul and became a mere [[Echo|shade]], known as *Arizhmiya*, causing the [[Old world|old world]] to fall into obscurity.

Eventually, it used its old body to damage the home of the [[angel|angels]]. Two embers of the [[blackflame|blackflame]] corpse fell to the remnant of [[High Sacred|Carapa]] in the age where the angels still controlled it, a consequence of Arizhmiya's meddling. 

One burned across what is now the modern-day [[Kurjan Badlands]], while the other fell into the [[Starcrater Fields]] and created the Starcrater, so named for its shape as well as its creation of a [[Power star|power star]] (through colliding with a powerful deposit of [[Mana]]) at the point of impact. 

The collective energy of both impacts caused [[Mount Celestia]] to erupt, killing many more angels, and for Carapa to split in half: into [[High Sacred]] and [[Low Sacred]]. It was for this act that Arizhmiya was punished, shackled to the [[Scarlet Skies]] by [[Lex|Eriva]]. This also precipitated the end of the Age of the Gods.

The blackflame eventually led to the birth of [[Arahabaki]].
