**Anacoreta**, the [[Bullion#Miracle City|Miracle City]] of the Court of Hands, is a city in the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]], often called her "northern capital". 

# History

Far from the bases of production and power in the [[Aed & Maed]], the city endured many scars of the bloodshed (and subsequent dissent) during the [[Bullion Civil War|civil war]] of [[Bullion]] around two centuries ago. 

After the conflict, and with the lack of reparations made to what many nobles of the time called a lost cause, Anacoreta grew increasingly displeased with the lack of care their people were treated with. The region thusly has become a bit of a cesspool of factions opposing what some call an "occupying force" in the [[Sganyodaiyo]].

This ultimately culminated in the past 70 years with the creation of [[Raghain]]. Following its founding, Anacoreta itself has... simmered down, in the intervening years, but there's plenty of bad seeds still sown for a lack of action 200 years prior.
