A **fiend** is, broadly, a term for a native inhabitant of the [[Scarlet Skies]]. Fiends are [[immortal]] figures associated with [[Void energy|negative energy]], [[fire]], and sin, who both war with and occasionally cooperate with the [[Divinity]]. In part due to their connection with the process, they act as watchers over the [[Petitioner|petitioned]] [[Soul|souls]], preventing them from escaping and punishing them for crimes committed during life.

It often refers to either [[Devil|devils]] and [[Demon|demons]].

Fiend [[scion|scions]] can be vague as a description, especially due to the prevalence of fiend blood in hybridization used by cultists to create powerful allies. However, the most common uses of the description usually refer to [[tiefling|tieflings]].
