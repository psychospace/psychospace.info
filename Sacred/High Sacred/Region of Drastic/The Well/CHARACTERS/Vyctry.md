**Vyctry** is the [[Eidolon]] of [[The Well]], and embodies wisdom. 

A rare vindictive [[Eidolon]], he assembles those he trusts to investigate others he does not, often incentivizing competition and cutthroat industry. He seeks to understand the heavens, himself, and everyone, and one day travel beyond all of them. His symbol is an eye.
