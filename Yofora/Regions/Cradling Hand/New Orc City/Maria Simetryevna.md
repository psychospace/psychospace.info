**Mariposa Simetryevna**^[Марипоса Симтерьевна], known by *Maria*^[Мария], is the wife of [[Serena Nortia]]. An ex-Conductor, she had a difficult role as a [[Yofora|Yoforan]] ally to Serena during the [[Dragonic War]]. 

She resides in the [[Sovereign's Tower]] in [[New Orc City]], and operates out of the [[Nail of Nortia]].

She was previously one of the attendants of the [[Conductors of Court]], but was liberated from that duty by virtue of her being wed to Serena. She continues her duties as a figurehead in the upper echelons of government, primarily focusing on research at the Nail, helping to find ways to help many people with [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]]'s advanced scientific endeavors.

# History

She was raised by a New Orc noble family into the role of Conductor.

Being raised into that role by parents with high expectations for her, as both her and Serena were growing up, there was collaboration and hangouts between the two women. Maria always seemed interested in what Serena was up to, Serena was interested in Maria's things, and their relationship kind of hit off from there. 



This relationship also put her in the awkward state of both working with and completely avoiding [[Hazel Sobol]], [[Curse|cursed]] to "vy" for her spouse's love.
