**Stronn**, also known as **Straž**^[страж], is a [[star]] in the [[Out There]]. It is the nearest-known star to [[Cien]], and like our star, [[Kibangan]]'s influence occludes it, casting a "shadow" known as [[the Sheer]]. It can be seen from [[the Planet]] at [[Starfall|night]], typically observed as a tiny, bright-blue star. 

Its influence creates the **Dobran-Clyfid [[Manifold Seas|Sea]]**, which may harbor life, though the Heavens lacks the technology to properly observe this star system. 

# Relevance
[[The Sheer]] has influence on the Planet as a proximal derivation of Kibangan. Within the mythology of [[Yofora]], a wish upon Stronn is what granted [[Uforia]]'s abilities.

In ancient times, Stronn's influential sea was a candidate endpoint of [[Ith'Alnna]]. 

The manifold sea's existence was proven in modern times by astronomers [[Dierdre Dobra]] and [[Tad Clyfjic]] at the [[Third Institute]] in [[1255 PT]]. Through research and parallax calculation, these two were able to synthesize fractions of a [[runic engine]] sequence which could^[if it were to be maintained at hypothetically-possible levels of moderated instability for a lengthy epoch (somewhere in the range of several centuries) and flouting the [[Chartless Sea#Chartlessness|chartless]] surroundings] punch a [[portal]] to this star system through the Sheer.

# Etymology
To the [[Temple of the Uforiad]], it is revered in [[Nortian (language)|Nortian]] as **Straž** or the "sentinel-star", where the [[Shindani]] term "Stronn" is derived from. It is also believed to be the source of the term "star" or "astronomy" itself.

In the time of [[Ith'Paraan]], Stronn's sea was known as the **Ith'Naia** ([[Oa'Rovi]]: "storm's destined borders") or the **Naian Sea**.
