Often mistaken for a severe manifestation of [[divination]], the ability to **travel through [[time]]** moves one's [[soul]] and [[body]] to an arbitrary point along the [[worldline]]. It is an incredibly rare and transgressive [[magic]] ability to demonstrate and control. 

It is most often a unintentional event caused by [[Altercation|malformed magic]], which indicates that time travel violates the tenets of the [[Divine Equation]]. Thusly, it is widely considered to be impossible by any normal or safe means to access.

Upon [[the Planet]], such a [[Arcane complexity|complex]] and dangerous ability has been purported to be controlled less than twelve times in all known history prior to [[Zero Day]], and all cases have reasons to be conjecture, mere fairy tales, or exaggerations. A "victim" of time travel is known as a [[discrepant]]. 

# Commonalities
Despite the rarity with which it appears, it is possible to determine several common points in mythos with which one can speculate.

Such an ability is often entangled with extreme propensity for [[teleportation]], and one which holds power over one domain likely holds power over another.

Due to [[logic]], three continuously referenced factors emerge, are considerations in events regarding time travel.
- Self-reference: one can only manipulate events as far back as their own [[epitome]].
- Self-consistency: that events in history happen as recorded; that a traveler to the past will only take actions that fulfill history rather than alter it. In other words, [the grandfather paradox is impossible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle). 
- Self-existence: that an entity may cause its own creation, or may have no origin at all, due to a causal loop.

What is impossible appears to be the outright [[reality-bending|alteration]] of the past, especially beyond one's own lifespan, which has never been demonstrated -- save for, possibly, the abilities of the [[tailed stranger]], believed exceptional by the people that gave it instructions.

In the lore of [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]], [[Amakudari's phantom|the Promise]] was a message conveyed to its younger self. However, that message itself led to the events which caused it to create the Promise, so its existence was self-creating.

All of this possibly goes out the window when considering [[Worldline#Transcendence|transcendence]] of a worldline, though nobody truly knows the in-depth details of such an effort.

# Adjacent abilities
**Time superperception**, the ability to freely witness one's own future or past in perfect clarity, is only slightly more common, at less than thirty cases, most of which are connected to [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]] and its [[Gift of Stars]].

**Retrogression**, the manipulation of an object's lifespan so it might be more ancient and significant in the present, is an ill-understood factor in creating [[Antique#False antiques|false antiques]], but is known to being unable to directly affect [[Soul|souls]], as well as extremely dangerous due to the unknown factors applied in affecting such history.
