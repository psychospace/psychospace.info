The **Heavens** is a [[Shindani]] term which describes the physical [[Plane#Realm|realms]] of influence of [[Psychospace|psychospace]], especially the [[The Planet#Planar stack|planar stack]], as part of the [[Antic Sea]]. It is widely used interchangeably to describe [[the Planet]] (usually her [[creature|inhabitants]]) and her [[Lex|two]] [[Ordo|moons]], creations of the [[Divinity|gods]]. 

Within the Heavens, [[magic]] and [[Logic]] are known to function as described. Most within the world can only dream what is beyond the Heavens, somewhere [[Out There|Out There]].

Under modern definitions, the Heavens are known to comprise at least the planets of the [[Antic Sea]]. It is unknown if the Heavens may comprise any other planets beyond the Antic Sea, though some [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] texts suggest so.
