![[âŽ‹ 2FPG]]
Colloquially called a _talkstone_ or MC, the **Electron Milieu Consensus Device** is a short-range radio-computing interface using [[Rivenium|riven]] alloys. It enables wireless vocal connection to a [[Dust tunnel#Milieu|locus station]], usually distributed to signaling officers. 

An EMCD is a common sight in cities where [[Dust tunnel|leywires]] span much of the surrounding surface area, such as [[Eleyda]] and [[Karyos]].

Initially developed in Sacred following the discovery of the properties of [[Verlan|verlan]] and [[noemite]] together, the MCD was invented by [[Hieron Dredge]] and [[Arthur Graywell]] as an extrapolation of the protection field around the capital city of [[Drastic]], created by the [[Tower of Electron]].
