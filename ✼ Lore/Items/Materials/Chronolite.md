**Chronolite** is a [[Mana]] alloy that can be "frozen in time" under certain reactive conditions, making it almost entirely unmovable save for impossibly heavy loads. It was used by the [[Carapa Republic]] to construct bridges and buildings desired to be timeless wonders, such as the [[Sienn Byway]], the [[Destiny Cathedral]], the [[Astral Lighthouse]], and the [[Constellar School]].

Chronolite is forged where concentrations of [[Light (property)|Light]] form physical impurities in other crystals: notably [[Orichalcum]].

The immovable rod is an item crafted of chronolite. The conditions required to freeze it are created manually through the button press.

A [[Wraithsword]] made of chronolite, *the Storm Reaver*, was placed in the grounds of [[Fort Rachis]], imbuing that land with similar properties.
