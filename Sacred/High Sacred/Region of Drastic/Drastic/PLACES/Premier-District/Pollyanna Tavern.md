The **Pollyanna Tavern** is a world-renowned tavern in the [[Premier District]], a block or two away from Battery Avenue. The head *chef de cuisine* is **Cassandra ‘Cassie’ Asobi**, a master culinarian from [[Dawndust]]. 

It is famous for its *cioppino*, a type of fish stew combining [[fish]], crabs, and other maritime bounties cooked in wine and tomatoes, as well as its *dream cookies*, a sort of deep-blue pastry imbued with magical properties that allow one to recover small amounts of magical power or see in the dark.
