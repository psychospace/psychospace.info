A **doppelganger** or **doppel** is a shapechanger who freely assumes identities and has little will of their own. They are a usually misanthropic derivation, born of a failure by a [[changeling#Medial changeling|medial]] to properly emotionally develop.

Their name is derived from an old [[Shindani]] word for "double-walker". In the past, all [[changeling|changelings]] were known by this name.

# Behavior
During the process of their creation (sometimes known as 'revolutionizing'), doppelgangers lose what many other creatures would be considered essential for sentience, in particular the ability to feel empathy or sympathy, turning feral. Though their ability enables them to slip in and out of society cleanly, they rarely interact with others outside of any goal they are given or seek out themselves.

Because they lack something key to their [[soul|soul]]'s aether, they must devour the [[vibe|Vibe]] of others to survive. All actions a doppel partakes in is ultimately in service of devouring powerful emotions as food, which they usually do by infiltrating families and feeding on their love for one another.

When a doppelganger fathers a child with another humanoid, that child will usually be born a [[Changeling#Axial changeling|mayling]] of indeterminate axiom. It is extremely difficult for the emotionally-undeveloped doppelganger to raise a family effectively, and so it often does not even bother, vacating its old family in hunt of more food.


# Existence in society
Doppels are apparently good at infiltration and sabotage, due to a lack of care for societal norms. It is known that Nortia keeps a force called the [[Prime Doppelguard]], largely consisting of these very creatures.
