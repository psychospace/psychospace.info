**Johanna "Jenny" Vela Abascal** is a 20-year-old [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|Paraani]] [[human|human]]. Presumed dead when she was caught during the [[burning of the Tuck farm]], she apparently survived the events, going missing shortly afterward. 

Johanna is wanted by the [[Fifth Institute]] for her hosting of *[[Mournful Cry]]*, a [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin]].


# History

Johanna was raised by her father [[Sandalio Vela]] in the modest settlement of [[San Arias]]. Her mother, [[Gavriella Abascal]], was a meteorologist and noble scholar who eventually returned to [[Raghain]]. Jenny was taught in a one-room school for most of her life.

After having a chance encounter with the [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin]] known as [[Mournful Cry|The Mournful Cry]], a series of tragedies and terrifying discoveries occurred. This came to a head when she twice encountered [[Thousand Rider]], a knight drawn towards lynchpin devices. 

The [[Burning of the Tuck farm|second time]], her friend [[Pollyanna Tuck|Pollyanna]] had both her parents killed in front of her, and Jenny's own father was severely wounded. In attempting to [[Reality-Bending|bend reality]] and save the two of them, the burning house she thought would be her grave vanished, [[Collapse state|rescuing herself]] at the apparent cost of her friend. 

She has since gone missing, evidently not dead after her father recalls Johanna's magic reviving him.
