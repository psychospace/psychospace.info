A **collapse state**, codified as the complete reduction or destruction of a *[[worldline]]*, is understood by [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturges]] to occur with the most severe [[Altercation|altercations]], as is what appears to have happened to the [[elseworld]].

Specifically, a collapse state is a [[Context|state]] which causes the [[The Heavens|Heavens]] to lose the ability to support [[Logic|Logic]], effectively bringing all chance or potential in the world to a tenuous and abrupt halt: in other words, the [[End Times|end of the world]]. 

The end of the world as a potential consequence of [[New Magic]] has motivated groups such as the [[Fifth Institute]] to attempt to understand the science and prevent it from causing harm.

# Concept
It consists of the destruction of infinite other, unrelated probabilities as a result of something so improbable being forced to occur. 

The concept of a collapse state has existed as long as [[Witchcraft]] has, and its existence proves [[⊛ The First Rule|the First Rule]]: instead of reality simply breaking to your whim and surviving the damage, reality is more liable to fully collapse and implode, causing a flood of change, damnation, destruction, and extinction throughout the rest of reality. 

The concept was observed and studied in laboratory-setting first by those who discovered [[KILL-SWITCHER]], which has the simple ability of ablating a reality.

The term was invented by [[Ema Ekotoba]]. Older, common terms for the apocalyptic state include **nubbin** or **NBN** (standing for "nothing-but-nothing").

%%## Alternative concepts
Some believe, instead of reality 'ending' in some cataclysmic apocalypse event, a "collapsed" reality simply fades from observability or relevance to others. This effectively would cut a reality off from one another, without affecting the lives of unrelated people.

In this hypothesis, the [[Elseworld]] is liable to be the only observable worldline in this state of existence.%%

# Ark effect
In an application of macro-scale [[bias coagulation]], known here as the "ark effect", things which bring about a collapse state, or are nearby when a collapse state manifests, tend to survive them.

The psychological (not to mention psionic) impacts on someone who has experienced a terminus of a worldline is unprecedented, and such beings usually brings with them several consistent distortions of reality.
