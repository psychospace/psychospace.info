The **River-Lands of Ancestral Ith’Paraan** (abbreviated: **AIP**) is the modern state based in the vast area around [[Mount Sokron]] and along the [[Ithika River Valley]] of [[Bullion]], occupying the middle-east to north-middle of the remnant. As the name implies, it lays claim to most of the ruins of [[Ith'Paraan]].

Its existence in modern forms spans five millennia, making it one of the oldest countries in the world, and easily counted as a seat of power in [[Bullion]]. Tensions between its long-lived citizens and societies at other speeds have resulted in historically-observed disparity. 

Its capital city is [[Eleyda]], and the current [[Luminaria]], ruler over the AIP, is **Ithuriel XII** (better known as [[Ithana Rysae|Suisei]]). The AIP was a founding body of [[the Shibboleth]].

 Its architectural style could be described as similar to Ottoman architecture.%%

# History
The AIP was initially founded around BPT 4000 by conquistadors from [[Archipel]], led by the charismatic hero [[Ithuriel Rysae|Ithuriel the First]] who became the first luminaria.

The River-Lands have seen cultural growth in recent years due to apparent astounding discoveries in the region, the [[Age of Adventurers]] in general, and the annual [[Meteor Dance]] over the [[Aedil Plains]] drawing more and more tourists each year. 

# Etymology
The demonym of the River-Lands is “_paraño/a_” or “_arnecano/a_” in Bullion’s dialect of [[Mänyya]] (and in most parlance) and “Paraani” in [[Shindani]].
