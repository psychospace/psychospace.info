**Broadcasters** are a uniquely-gifted type of magician which arose following the [[new magic|magical deviances]] created by the [[Dragonic War]]. The clade is defined by the ability to perceive [[The Signal|the signal]] naturally, usually interpreted by the senses as faint music. 

A Broadcaster is able to use this perception as a channel for [[Reality-Bending|reality-bending]] [[Magic|magic]], and not necessarily in a way they can control.

Typically, they are proficient [[Psion|psions]]: this is not a given, however, as some struggle to control their abilities and thus can't be called a "caster" in the traditional sense. 

# Definition

Owing to their natural propensity, they are typically spared the more basic "[[New Magic|new-magic]]" work that has been cropping up since it emerged: for example, a Broadcaster [[Shotcaller|shotcaller]] is a rare sight.

When identified, broadcasters are usually determined to have a [[Codec]] if their proficiency in a particular facet of reality-bending is significant enough. In those without strong control over their powers, this amounts to the effects of their [[Haze|haze]]. 

While Broadcasters on the whole find themselves catalogued and tagged by governments like the [[Fifth Institute]], some are given special descriptions, such as the [[Fulcrum|fulcrums]] or [[Sophist|sophists]].
