An **engram**, sometimes called an **inevitable**, is a [[Lynchpin device|lynchpin]]-like living [[Divinity|divine]] construct, of varying size, shape, and role, native to the [[First City]]. They are, as one world-traveler phrased it, the City's "weapons" in the perpetual effort to prevent a second [[War of Chaos]].

Similar to lower-sphere [[Angel|angels]], an engram, or engram collective, is purpose-built to fit a predefined [[domain]], specifically oriented on reinforcing and refining individual laws of the [[Divine Equation]], as well as pursue and deter anybody which might want to [[Reality-Bending|break those laws]].

They are themselves [[Monitor|monitors]], though of a lower derivation than their [[Harmon|Harmoni]] creators and thus not in [[demon#^22fab1|control of their immortality]]. Engrams are all individually constructed by Harmoni.

It is theorized by denizens of the [[elseworld]] that it has been a long time since an engram has ever spared their realm a thought.
