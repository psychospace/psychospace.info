**Osprey Bay** is a well-known city in [[Low Sacred]], often viewed as a vacation town.

An artificial beach is what this town is commonly known for. It isn't often heavily populated outside of the summer months, but those who do live there yearround admire either the technology that makes the town possible or the technological marvels often constructed there for use by the C&C forces of Sacred. Along the Kyuna Barrier, many monks make offerings o'er the precipice of reflection.
