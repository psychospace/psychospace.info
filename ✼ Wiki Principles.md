# General World Guidelines
If the wiki lacks context that would support or reject the existence of something (for example, a specific animal, "class" or "spell"), it is **open to definition**. 

# What Gets an article?
The following rules are intended to apply wiki-wide.


## Rule of Notability
**Notable** subjects will receive articles.

Articles are created for *notable subjects* in the world. Generally, I use the [Wikipedia Notability tests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability), adapted for this purpose. Because the only sources are stories, we can use that as a measure.

Notable subjects include:
1. Elements well-covered in a story, "the obvious picks" (i.e. [[1250 PT]])
2. Key elements in a story (i.e. [[Blackflame]])
3. Common knowledge in-universe (i.e. [[Critical Hit]]), speculative elements (i.e. [[End Times]]), or fundamental elements of the universe (i.e. [[Magic]]) ^085ad0
4. Player characters in roleplays ( #meta/PLAYER ) 
5. Non-trivial settings of stories (i.e. [[Drastic]])
6. Subjects which are **reliably relevant** to stories (i.e. [[Lazuli Dino]])
    - Appears in more than one story or session (i.e. [[Buttons and Snooze]])
    - Directly connected to a notable subject in a non-trivial manner (i.e. [[Macha]])
    - Appears in a single story in a non-trivial manner (i.e. [[Enoch Starfell]])

A notable subject must also be without reason to have its article redacted in its entirety.

**All notable subjects should receive articles.** Articles might not exist, or links may be broken, if their subject(s) is not notable. Generally, notable subjects that should receive an article (but don't have one, yet) include:
* intentionally hidden information (i.e. major villains)
* genuinely overlooked content
* low-priority notable subjects (i.e. different classes)

## Spontaneity
An article will be created for an unplanned or improvised element if it *becomes* notable.^[i.e. The duergar of [[Otell Sanctum]] would not receive articles, as Otell Sanctum suffices, but [[Magnet (tiefling)|Magnet]] has an article because the [[S4]] interacted differently with him.]
## Precedence
When another notable subject's article can cover a subject sufficiently, that article will be amended to contain further information (i.e. the topic of types of dragon are sufficiently covered by headers in the [[Dragon]] article).

If ever the alternate subject becomes significant enough to cover elsewhere, it will be extracted into its own article and linked in the parent article (i.e. [[Airship]] and [[Void breaker]]).

## Stubless
An article will be created when that article would amount to more than "the subject exists". 

i.e. player characters' homes would generally not receive note, as their containing location is probably sufficient. Not every citizen of [[Drastic]] needs their own article.


## Wikipedia
When a topic is too generic to be notable or distinct enough to the Heavens, a link to Wikipedia will suffice. For example, [[fire]]:

> ![[Fire#^a9cdc3]]

Despite the fact that the Heavens is vastly different from our own universe, it is not necessary to go into severe detail on certain topics which are concepts shared between them. 

However, if an article WOULD contain a lot of Heavens-specific information, again as [[fire]], [[earth]], [[water]], and [[air]] detail, then it will be given its own article.

## Rule of "Not Mine"
![[⎋ Gameplay]]
Articles should be written in a system-agnostic manner.

**System-agnostic** means: No TTRPG system's gameplay descriptions (e.g. gameplay mechanics, stat blocks) will need to be understood to understand the contents of the wiki. 
- If homebrew content is placed on the wiki, it will not need to be read to understand the in-universe purpose of a device.
- Links to external sources like *Archives of Nethys* intended to eventually be replaced and rewritten to be agnostic. 

The end-goal of becoming system agnostic is a universe that does not require external sources to support its content, as well as offering its own, "Heavens-flavored" interpretation of system-typical elements. This should also allow fans of the work to create their own interpretations.
