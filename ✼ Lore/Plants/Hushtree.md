A **[[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] hushtree** is a species of novel magic-borne tree which appears to accumulate [[Cloudscape|clouds]] using its limbs during the summer, an evolutionary trait which allows it to collect and maintain a store of water.

Though originating from [[Yofora]], where it was often worshipped as a physical manifestation of [[the Sheer]]'s influence, it has spread far and wide, especially so following [[Zero Day]] and the reinvention of the [[Great Nortian Empire]].

Hushtrees are particularly vulnerable to fostering [[pale reecher]], which favors the ends of its branches and feasts off the clouds.
