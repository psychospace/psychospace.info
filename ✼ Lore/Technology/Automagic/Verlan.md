**Verlan**^[[[Shindani|Common]]: *vurr-LEN*, from original [[Sylvan]]: *where-LAHN*] is a crystalline material (also called **dust**) sourced from within [[the Fortress]]. This crystal material behaves like an [[echo]] and holds a special form of energy, called **verlanic energy**, which can power [[automagic]] machines.

It is sometimes also simply called **Ley** or **Leytech**, due to the effects of the energy, as well as the tendency for [[Dust tunnel|dust tunnels]] to be built following natural leylines.

The technology behind verlan is largely considered the next step in the automagic revolution which began with [[lux]], and originates from [[the Fortress]], and most commonly deposits of [[noemite]] which have emerged from [[Väräh]]. 

# Properties
## Physical

Verlan dust resembles small, shiny bits of glassy material, of varying colors and textures. Though typically invisible to the naked eye, raw verlan dust can reveal itself through belief or through an external medium which occludes it (typically water).

This dust is highly-reactive to proximal [[Off-wave|off-waves]], including the slightest influences caused by thought alone: The properties of verlan dust are best summarized as a magnification of the thoughts of the source. This influence must be incredibly physically close, however, within 1m or less.

For some examples, verlan can change observed colors if a person observing it from less than 5 feet away simply thinks of the color; one can also easily move a single grain of dust from one place to another, without a clear medium, through will alone. [[Spell|Spells]] cast through dust-glass foci are immensely powerful, bordering on [[wild magic]].

One can also turn one grain into two into 200, though each duplication consumes some of the potential energy within the dust, and has the chance to produce [[#Cruft|cruft]].

## Psionic
The motion of verlan itself produces a powerful [[psinomenon]], similar to the movement of [[lux]], though it harbors less unstable properties.

When dust comes into contact with an especially resonant object, such as a node of [[noemite]], the dust uses the "echo" of that contact to enter [[psychospace]] and use the resonant object as a medium. While inside psychospace, it appears to physically [[Portal#^d4d606|teleport]] while using the resonant object as a medium. 

This ability for the dust to be charged with [[Echo|data]], and then to turn transversal at the whim of repeatable code, is what grants it its nature as an energy.

## Energy
Verlan can be sent through a semiotic or resonant conduit, known as a [[dust tunnel]]. A semiotic conduit conveys verlan dust through desire alone, while resonant uses the above property. Both allow the transfer, storage, and propagation of [[Echo|psychic data]] and [[Psychic code|code]] across vast distances, though with some time delay.

Verlan's modern use has led to a generation of inventors using and advancing the technology, specifically radios, radio-computing, and telephony, as part of the ongoing trends of artifice and overall zeitgeist of “[[New Magic|new magic]]”. This has mostly been used for communication across [[Bullion]], especially in academia and government.

Verlanic instruments can pick up the influence of the [[The Signal|Signal]] as well as other rogue influences, making their practical adoption important as a countermeasure against [[new magic]].

# Production
Just like lux is centric on [[Light (property)|Light]], verlanic energy is a fundamental energy which can be commonly observed in [[psychospace]], but not interacted with directly while inside there. It is usually observed through and described with modeling [[Phoreus field|phoreus fields]] for the local environment.

Through machines known as tranducers, the above duplication-factor can create safe amounts of new dust from old dust.

Verlanic energy is generated naturally in small amounts by electromagnetic radiation and other processes, such as exposure to [[the Sheer]].

## Cruft
Despite being invisible to the naked eye and intermittently intangible when propagated through a dust tunnel, verlanic dust which remains physically stable and stagnant, like [[Lux#nox|nox]] before it, can contaminate reality left unchecked.

Such dust will eventually degenerate into a pink, purple, and red physical [[Mana|mana]]-like particulate, also called **cruft**, which is very cold to the touch. 

The issues of [[#cruft]]-generation are why it is important for a tunnel network to be calibrated correctly. Accumulating cruft can corrupt or alter the whole psinomenon based on its purity, so controlling their pollution levels is in the network's best interest. ^8d9058

Cruft can be eliminated through [[Reality-Bending|reality-bending]] it away, though this redirection itself can have implications across the entire network.

# History
Within the Fortress, verlan is among the many materials used in "bricks", used to construct the conduits which make up over half of the plane. These bricks tend to reshape themselves roughly according to fundamental forces, and this dust is why.

Though _verlan_ as an element had been known about for years, only rarely used by the [[Witchcraft|witches]] who were used to the Fortress, it was the [[Nortian Conspiracy]] who put it into common engineering use during the [[Dragonic War]]. A mining operation was later discovered just inside the conduit into the Fortress created by the [[House Parasom|Parasom]] twins, which had studied the material thoroughly. 

Following the breaking of the occupation, Empress [[Serena Nortia|Serena]] shared the infant technology with other remnants. 
 
The discovery of noemite's compatibility with the technology massively sped up the ability to transmit things via verlan.
