**Vyctry** is the [[eidolon]] of [[The Well]], and embodies wisdom. 

A rare vindictive eidolon, he assembles those he trusts to investigate others he does not, often incentivizing competition and cutthroat industry. He seeks to understand [[the Heavens]], himself, and everyone, and one day travel beyond all of them. His symbol is an eye.
