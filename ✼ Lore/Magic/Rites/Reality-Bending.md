![[⎋ 2FPG]]
**Reality-bending**, or **reality-alteration,** is a generic term for an arbitrary, low-dependence change made to [[Universe|reality]]'s present [[context|context]]: often in a localized, immediate-effect manner, but sometimes in a [[Curse|curse]]-like, impermanent manner. The term is used prominently in the context of “[[New Magic]]”.

Due to their general ignorance of the processes of the [[Divine Equation]], the act of bending is liable to cause [[Altercation|altercations]]. A **reality-bender** (or simply **bender** for short) is any [[Creature|creature]] with a predilection to make these types of changes.
# Definitions

## Informal definition
A reality-bend is performed not necessarily using the processes or restrictions required by most [[Magic]], especially the identification of specific [[Spell|spells]]. The reach of a bend is often unpredictable and widespread, as is the case with many [[Codec|Codecs]] or [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpins]]. 

Learning how to bend reality is a cornerstone of occult teachings (new and old), and something made greatly more possible with [[The Signal|the Signal]].

## Formal definition
*As it has been defined by [[Ema Ekotoba]] of the [[Fifth Institute]]:*

When using their abilities, a reality-bender creates at least *ONE* chiral [[Context]]: a reality where the change they desire is present.[^1] Such a context is probably impossible to reach by normal means.

The goal of reality-bending, in simplest terms, is to force an impossible thing into a possible reality (usually a low-activity context).[^2] This may be done consciously or unconsciously. When this is performed, known as an *overlay event* or *reality merge*, the excesses of the process are hazardous and dangerous, and thus considered a form of [[Wild Magic]]. Repetitious overlays can cause a byproduct to emerge known as [[Haze]].

In the most-stable forms of reality-bending, similar to standard [[Magic]], effort is put in to make the change itself more "possible" before instigating the overlay, thus minimizing the potential danger. This is why many complex effects (even in as freeform a medium as new-magic) take the form of [[Ritual|rituals]], and why many rudimentary effects take the form of already-achiral-events, such as existing spells.

[[Bias coagulation]] will attempt to resolve this from the perspective of an observer, a form of minor altercation.

[^1]: More accurately, the possibilities are *discovered* from a probability set (of compatible [[Worldline|worldlines]]) as interpreted by the caster, such as the [[Gift of Stars]]. What reality-benders call "surface-level" changes are those that are more probable at a baseline, and thus are easier to access: for example, the position of a freckle. The less probable an event, the more severe the [[Altercation|altercations]] it will inflict as part of its overlay.
[^2]: The change is best compared to a "[rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider_(legislation))" in the legislative sense.
