**Suzuran** was a mysterious presence which originally appeared as a [[flail snail]], guiding wanderers in the [[Giant Forest]] with her questionable voice and even more questionable advice. It was a vanguard of the eastern entrance to [[Cherryheart]], outside the [[Polyglot Grove]].

However, in reality, she was an apparition created by a psychoactive [[devil's trumpet]] patch nearby. Her status as of [[1285 PT]] is unknown.

# History
## Interactions with the S4
The [[S4|Royal Escort Group]] encountered Suzuran during [[MMT - Arc 1, Nova#12-16-1250|Arc 1]]. There, it gave confounding directions and caused them to nearly miss rescuing [[Cherryheart]] from the crashing of the [[Aerkastelo]].

After the mission to [[Dom Otdykha]], the S4 again passed through its area during [[MMT - Arc 3, Syzygy|Arc 3]]. This time, they attempted to kidnap the "flail snail", but to little effect, realizing that Suzuran had been a fabrication of the plant life all this time.

## Fate following [[Zero Day]]
During the immediate few months following Zero Day, [[Shohei Integra]] traveled the same route as they had during their initial adventure through [[Low Sacred]] (but without Serena's puppeteering: "it seemed important to try to make those memories my own"). During this trip, the devil's trumpet patch which summoned up the personage of Suzuran was marked with a large sign which reads: *"THE SNAIL IS REAL. - S.I."* At some point, this sign was modified so its author was labeled "S4".

The local guards continually had to remove this sign to address concerns around constant psychedelic episodes in the Giant Forest, but, perhaps on the order of [[Serratura Neeman|some kind of mischief-maker]], they always kept going back up for years after.

Eventually, when [[Arthur Graywell|Arthur]] established his school in the region, and after someone had a severe allergic reaction to the plant, the construction company contracted to build the school's campus demanded that a new trail be created around the patch to avoid further incident. Arthur, upon investigation, discovered that the patch no longer produced hallucinations of a particular annoying voice, nor the snail it was attached to. 

With the means of addressing invasive species like that essentially improbable in the Giant Forest, the trail was still constructed to avoid the psychedelics-inducing plant life. The sign remains as a historical marker, but the "snail" it speaks of seems to have long-since vacated the premises...
