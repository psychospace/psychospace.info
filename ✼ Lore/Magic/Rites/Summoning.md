In arcane terms, **summoning** is a complex [[Magic|magical]] study of **summoners**, typically involving the [[soul bond|anchoring]] of a [[figment]] or temporarily-figmented being to one's own [[soul]], drawing it across space using a [[portal]] in order to secure or request its aid. This also typically involves additional [[Abjuration|abjuring]] effort to prevent the creature from acting against the caster's intent.

Though summoning is a rite practiced by many [[Magic#Clade|clades]] for a variety of reasons, the archetypal summoner is one that has anchored an [[origo]] to themselves, with the origo acting as "another self" in combat and social scenarios. The other commonly-known type of summoning is one involving a complex portal which helps instruct that which steps through it: this is typically more open-ended in application, though it can be further specified such as by calling on the [[True name (concept)|true name]] of a creature.

Some of the most common uses of summoning are to "find" certain [[Echo|echoes]] and give them physical shape, such as in the case of spawning one's own [[familiar]] or regaining it after its return to its original form. Certain creatures, such as [[Immortal|immortals]], harbor the ability to summon forth lower-caste kin as part of protecting themselves.
