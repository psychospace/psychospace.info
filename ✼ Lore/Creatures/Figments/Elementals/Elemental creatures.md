Generated out of [[chaos]], **elemental [[Creature|creatures]]** (sometimes simply called "elementals") are powerful [[Figment|figments]] which collectively are the physical manifestations of the influence of [[elemental energy]] in the [[Antic Sea]]. 

There are several strata of elemental creatures. Almost all elementals do not have any sense of sapience, acting much like animals (even with immense psionic power). The exceptions are known as [[Whill|whills]].

# Strata
## Elder
The **elder elementals** are several rare, mythic, and extremely powerful elemental creatures, considered pinnacles of chaos. Almost synonymous with the highly-volatile [[weather]] systems they cultivate, elder elementals were the goals of and final byproducts of medial-type chaos before [[the Gathering]] rended it and made it unrecognizable.

Many of these elder elementals corroded and split into two paths: modern [[#Alpha|alpha elementals]], and [[Whill|whills]], who sought to exert command over the [[First Magicians]]. However, several elders were powerful enough to retain their sanctity and had their properties inherited by [[#Titan|titans]].

## Alpha
Alpha elementals are the modern  of elemental [[confluence]]. Existing in a variety of shapes, these elementals are somewhat simple-minded, both embodying and protecting a specific form or aspect of nature.

Alpha elementals are largely incapable of altering their shape, except as the fluidity of their specific aspect describes. For example, a water elemental may take the form of a slimy-armed humanoid shape, an animal made out of waves, a living geyser, or a five-fingered hand, among others. Alphas are, in a literal sense, forces of nature, and therefore do not express much willpower except to bend to the elements as they please.

Alphas are the most common kind of [[summoning|summoned]] elementals, owing to their relative lack of intelligence.

## Titan
Titan elementals are the most powerful form of elemental which remain in the Antic Sea, following the destruction of the [[#Elder|elder]] caste. The originators of [[Giant|giants]], titans command immense respect over the ecosystems they dwell within.
