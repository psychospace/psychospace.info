A **dream-eater** is a type of [[figment]] [[slime]] (specifically categorized as a [[mimic]]) which consumes powerful [[Echo|echoes]] (such as dreams), granting it knowledge, physical form, and sustenance, though at the cost of causing minor [[Off-wave|off-waves]] or memory-disruption in its environment. 

A lesser form of an [[oblex]], dream-eaters are generally considered annoyances, but can occasionally be [[Summoning|summoned]] for protection or aid. Once a dream-eater grows to be of a particular age, it can become quite intelligent, similar to [[Sliver|slivers]], and can prove potent (though mischeivous) allies.

# Biology
In their natural state, a dream-eater is a gaseous lifeform that drifts along the [[phoreus field|flows of energy]] in [[psychospace]]. They will hang around areas that have significant history, as this provides them with a continuous source of food, such as recently-abandoned locations like manor houses or churches. 

It is said that dream-eaters are born at such locations, though in all recorded history nobody has directly witnessed a dream-eater's genesis; it is widely theorized that they are similar to [[quori]] in that they spawn as a result of the natural states of psychospace.

Dream-eaters are, physically, entirely [[âœ¼ Glossary#^3b5713|ethereal]], formed of implication, and similarly able to shapechange as desired. Though shapeless by nature, assuming a shape is not impossible. While taking a physical form, dream-eaters are almost indistinguishable from a physical counterpart, though it should be noted that any contact made with a dream-eater is in some way an [[illusion]], even if it is incredibly convincing. 

As one account recalls, dream-eaters prefer assuming physical forms as it allows them easier access to food, though it is difficult and burns a great deal of energy.

Despite this reliance on prior experience, as well as dream-eaters' self-descriptions of their love for history and dreams specifically, dream-eaters are not incapable of producing novel ideas of their own, synthesized from personal experiences. In some cases, similar to other forms of neutral slimes, dream-eaters either adopt or create a preferred form that they regularly assume. 

# Nature
Dream-eaters try to create optimum environments for themselves, and have a variety of tactics for eliciting memorable events that they can take advantage of. 

Making contact with a dream-eater has the potential to induce an alcohol-like inebriation in a creature, which is a natural defense that further makes it easier for dream-eaters to devour memories out of the [[soul|souls]] of their targets. Dream-eaters are also [[Telepathy|telepathic]]^[Typically in a receptive capacity, though a dream-eater can add to their own illusions through implantation of thoughts], able to read minds effortlessly, through comprehending the shape and contents of echoes attached to specific souls.

Dream-eaters who begin to learn a lot about a particular target may develop a selfish guilt for their actions, and will try to disrupt a person as little as possible when they become so "attached":  they will try to provoke significant emotional responses from their unwitting "prey", creating echoes they can then devour. 

In the course of their games and deceptions, dream-eaters often take the form of loved ones (such as a pet or family member), as the emotional reactions provoked by such a form require little effort to "act" on the part of the dream-eater. Because of these factors, dream-eaters can be mistaken for [[ghost|ghosts]] when those loved ones are deceased.
