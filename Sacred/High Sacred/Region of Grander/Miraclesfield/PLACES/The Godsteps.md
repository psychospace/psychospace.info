The **Godsteps** collectively refer to a trail up to the peak of [[Miraclesfield]]'s central mountain of [[Laika]]. The "steps" are a famous landmark of the town for their ambition and aesthetic.

They hold reverence for the multitude of known forces that affect the everyday, symbolized by the shrines every five steps. Each shrine is a meticulously crafted construction to almost every god or entity known to exist in any minor influence in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] and its history, save for the Gods-Who-Turned who are suppressed by Sacred, although their worship fall under the Shrine of the Further.

The monks of the Godsteps maintain lore and stories on each of the hundreds of gods represented in their installation, capped off with a shrine giving emotional offerings to the Greivance of [[Exponen]], the stillborn god of figments. Recent events have left the archives disorganized, and the repurification of each shrine somewhat difficult.
