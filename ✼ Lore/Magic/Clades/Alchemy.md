**Alchemy** is the [[Magic|magical]] study of **alchemists**, involving the understanding of molecular composition and [physical philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_philosophy), and the world's atomic interactions with [[psychospace]]. Largely considered a subject best-tread by [[Enchantment|enchanters]], alchemists are specialized scientist-magicians who prepare medicinal solutions, virulent poisons, and powerful mutagens (collectively known as "chemics") via their understanding of both the magical and non-magical world.

Originating in various forms out of the focusing of folk traditions, modern alchemical study started to emerge as a field of study about four millennia Before [[Pinwheel Tempo]], with a medical revolution that began in [[Archipel]] and spread to [[Bullion]]. It was alchemy that was the initial physical application of the various [[Classical Schools]].

Though individual alchemists perceive their field as thankless, alchemy has historically been the first line of defense against epidemics and virological threats, and their understanding of how to leverage psychospace in the creation of [[healing]] potions has saved innumerable lives over many years.
