A **copper piece** (cp), a coin minted from [[copper]], is a widely recognized currency throughout [[the Heavens]]. Different civilizations mint different types of coin, though these are usually pinned to the value of silver as a material. This is usually the smallest unit of currency in circulation: ten copper pieces make a [[silver piece]].

Copper as a currency emerged out of utility in many cultures.

# History
Coppers are widely believed to be the first coin ever minted on the remnant of [[Bullion]] and in the [[Mer de Vide]], if not the entire Heavens. The metal had practical use and could be found by refining malachite, a mineral and ore which regularly fell to Bullion from [[the Above]] and [[Umbraid]]. 

Many early pieces of armor and tools, found in archaeological sites around the [[Siella Valley]], were made of copper. However, [[Ith'Paraan]]'s advancements and access to [[The Above|Aboveite]] science made copper largely redundant; the ancient Ith'Par preferred bronze and electrum coinage. 

Thousands of years after the [[Os'Grun]] impact, copper was reintroduced to the cultures of the continent by [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan#History|the conquistadors]] traveling the [[Strait of Ithuriel]]. [[Archipel|Archipelian]] copper had seen refined use as a regular cornerstone of commerce, the bedrock of the wage system in the largest sea-towns due to the metal's commonality. 

Today, most copper pieces on the remnant are minted from copper mined in northwestern [[League of Joriele|Joriele]]. The collective of the Northern Passage has had consistent need of smaller coins to compete (if not conform) with existing trade networks. 

# Ratel
The **ratel** (pl. **rateles**) is the copper coin of [[Bullion]]. Rateles are stamped with and named for the design of a [[badger]] with three cubs, showing the fearsome resilience of nature and familial bonds. This is a well-recognized icon of the League of Joriele, emblematic of the [[Naciente|First Forest]] and the surrounding environs.

The tradition of the badger dates back to when the [[League of Joriele]] joined [[the Shibboleth]], and currency across the nations of the Shib were standardized.
