A **psinomenon** (*sih-nomm-enn-on*, pl. **psinomena**), also called an **off-tide** or sometimes a **leyline**, is a tide-like [[Psionics|psionic]] observation in [[Off-wave|off-waves]], a pattern in how [[psychospace]] flows with more or less energy based on location, time, or presence. Its name is a portmanteau of "psionic" and "phenomena". Psinomena are to psychospace what [[weather]] is to [[The Heavens]].

Due to the pervasiveness of psychospace, like laws of nature, psinomena can usually be observed without the identification of its source. Psinomena usually lead to the powers observed in [[Confluence|confluences]].

# Types
## Psintilla
In [[magic]], a **psintilla**^[sin-til-ah], sometimes also called a **psintillating field** or **artificial aura**, is an item or [[spell]] which creates an area-of-effect, maintained around the user through a psinomenon. In modern parlance, a psintilla usually means a [display device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device), or an array of devices, which hook up to [[automagic]] to monitor or communicate information about the state of a network.

This psinomenon is toggled through a quirk of its [[Viewpoint property|viewpoint]] being "unset", allowing anybody who controls the item or spell to give the psinomenon a source and take control of it. This term is used broadly, from weapons to shields: for example, the [[Nortian Conspiracy]] developed a psintillating field allowing control over [[Verlan#physical|dust]]-glass particulates, surrounding the user with dangerous abrasive material. 

The term is originally from [[MÃ¤nyya]], and means "spark".
