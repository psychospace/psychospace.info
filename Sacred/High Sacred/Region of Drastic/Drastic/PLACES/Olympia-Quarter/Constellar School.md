The **Constellar School of Arcane Arts** is a world-renowned school of magic studies. It has existed since before the early days of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]]. Its main campus is predominantly well known for floating architecture above the city of [[Drastic]]. It floats using the power of [[Chronolite]] and cantercrystal [[Rune]] towers below it.

The Constellar School and [[Saurus Castle]] have been tightly linked since each was formed. The School has the unenviable task of holding secret and still all extremely sensitive materials procured by the Kingdom, kept within a deep dark vault known as the Keyhole Archives. Few know for sure if these Archives even exist in Drastic, let alone in the [[Wild Blue Yonder]].
