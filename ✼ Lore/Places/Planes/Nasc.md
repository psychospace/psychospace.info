One of the only “[[artificial remnant projects]]” to survive to present day, the [[remnant]] of **Nasc** is a rare place of congregation and commerce between [[Whill|whill]] society and humanoid society, and a pinnacle of [[the Above]].

The whole landmass resembles an overgrown, shattered corpse of a great [[leviathan]], slain by unknown means during the Late Uzaher era of [[Pinwheel]] and set adrift in [[the Above]] by phantasmal spikes akin to [[Wraithsword|wraith weapons]].

Due to its artificial status, the [[gravity]] it has developed is weak and slightly nauseating to most who call the [[Wild Blue Yonder]] their home.
