![[âŽ‹ 2FPG]]

Especially in unfamiliar scenarios, [[Soul|souls]] attempt to reconcile incoherent or incongruous [[Reality-Bending|altered]] [[Context|contexts]], such as those affected by [[magic]] (though especially [[new magic]]), through an effect studied as ***bias coagulation*** (or *eisegetic coagulation*). 

Their mind interprets a difficult perception by discerning that what they are looking at "makes sense", following evidence they already understand, such as existing [[Soul bond|bonds]]. For example, if a false [[Antique|antique]] is witnessed, someone may develop impossible memories, of having seen that object before its [[Epitome|epitome]] began. The "realness" of the memories in question are disputable.

Bias coagulation sometimes affects specific entities in certain intense ways, such as the [[Collapse state#Ark effect|ark effect]] that causes entities central to the oncoming of a collapse state to survive them.

# Antibias
There is also a reverse property exhibited by some, called ***antibias*** or *exegetic coagulation*, which allows some to perceive these changes for what they are. Instead of your mind telling you something makes sense, this instead pulls the perception of these effects back into the equation. This technique was originally identified by [[Arthur Graywell]] of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]], who developed the spell *[[psych ward]]* to trace spells.

Those with a high *[[Senzai|senzai]]* have a comorbid high propensity for antibias, able to identify the variations in the state of reality. The [[Fifth Institute]] (and increasingly, other factions) are attempting to hire more individuals with a substantial antibias, as well as develop tests for it. [[Sanza Rayo]]'s light can also establish one's propensity for antibias.
