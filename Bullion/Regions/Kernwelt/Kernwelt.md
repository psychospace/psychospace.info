![[âŽ‹ Needs Expansion]]
The **Kernwelt** (*kern-vellt*) is the geographic region which covers the lower center of the landmass of [[Bullion]]. It is largely the home to [[Dwarf|dwarvish]] and other tunneler folk inside dusty mesas and clay villages, such as the [[harengon]] of the [[Siella Valley]]. 

It is bordered to the north by the [[Upper Kernwelt]] and the [[Aed & Maed]] beyond it. Underground here are vast networks of complex ruins with [[Holrfold|a vast history]], which has led to a culture of survivalists and explorers who brave them. Push further south and you'll reach [[Sirrhad]].
