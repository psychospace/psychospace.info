**Ladybug** is a town in the Region of Precipice, [[Low Sacred]], surrounded by a small forest and bordered by large plains that roll and weave throughout.

# History
Around the end of the 7th century PT in [[675 PT]], the [[Carapa Republic|Carapaeans]] constructed a small shipyard town around [[Installation S.H.O.R.E.]] (now Shero's Reach) in order to maintain the massive weapon and keep the fort running. It would also aid in testing out equipment and weapons and such that could later be equipped to SHORE once tested. These weapons tests are what now scar the [[Precipice Plains]].

Through logs left behind by Carapaean soldiers, in [[742 PT]], this surface-level town was apparently outright abandoned once the forces of Falknjir approached [[High Sacred]], the Unitors here determined to save the [[Drastic|Holy Port of Ace]]. This marks a distinct difference from the other Unitors found in other places on Low Sacred, who were often concerned with maintaining independence or fleeing the remnant altogether.

Due to the alterations made to the landscape by the weapons tests, and the retraction of the [[Sienn Byway]], it took many years after the fall of the Republic for this land to see settlers again. The fort was autonomous, defending itself from invasion due to settings left flicked on by the fleeing Unitors. In [[801 PT]], a brave [[Victory Starscouts]] troop were able to thwart the machines and shut them down, leaving them to ruminate on what incited the creation of such a base.
