**Matilda "Tilly" Herringbone** is a human ex-dragoon from [[Rainbow Ridge]], business partners to [[Theresa Leighton|Tessa Leighton]]. The two of them run [[Grander General Goods and Bads]] in [[Lond Point]]. 

She once cited [[Abyz]] her best childhood friend, with Tessa her second. She enjoys watching people and sparring with her friends.

She enlisted in her mid-teens. After the [[War of the Masters]] ended, Tessa had seen her fill of war, with both tours of duty concerned with the often difficult and tedious [DDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disarmament,_demobilization_and_reintegration) efforts made during the ceasefire. War changed her into more of a local town mom, who can spy trouble a mile away.

She floated from job to job until hearing of the incentives given to those setting up shop in the boomtown of [[Lond Point]], where now national hero [[Drachedion Balthazar]] had decided to build his manor.

Her bloodhound, Tindy, watches the store with her, and follows her when she goes out to gather materials.
