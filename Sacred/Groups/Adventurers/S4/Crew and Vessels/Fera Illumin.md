**Fera Adamans Illumin** is the [[Novo Shindan|Shindani]] [[Elf|elven]] co-captain of the [[Airship]] *[[Wings of Dawn]]*, and the ex-captain of the *[[Red Diamond]]*, as employed by the [[S4]] in the dawning days of the [[Dragonic War]].

A military veteran of [[Dawndust]]â€™s western reaches, a sea elf whose smarts are surpassed only by her beauty.

# History
Fera was born into poverty in Dawndust in the [[10th century]], as her family's matriarch had recently come under heavy religious scrutiny and ostracization. After a difficult schooling where she abandoned her family name, she passed the entrance exam into the [[Helray Exploratory Navy|Helrays]], the novel exploratory naval forces of the regime at the time.

After studying for many years under a learned master, she captained a similar ship to the *[[Superbia-class]]* during the long [[War of the Masters]], a *[[Shrike-class]]* known as *[[Depthwalker]]*.  Following this, she fell out of love with the Helrays and adventured as part of a successor crew, traveling a long while and gathering renown, until meeting [[Seeley Crashburn]] in [[1246 PT]].
## Current Affairs
She was due to be married to Seeley on the Third of [[Augenschein]], [[1250 PT]], in [[Drastic]]. In an unprecedented bout of bad luck, the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]] occurred, destroying the *Depthwalker II* and disrupting the ceremony. With the assistance of the [[Windriders|Windriders]], they fled to [[Waxtown]] and then on to the [[Royal Bladeworks]].

Following the announcement of [[Project Ephemeris]], they met with the S4 and found others to form a new crew.
# Personality
She is relatively skilled at piloting but perhaps lacks in commanding the crew. She wants to fight as many monsters as she can in her lifetime, and if the party needs guidance, she is happy to provide.
