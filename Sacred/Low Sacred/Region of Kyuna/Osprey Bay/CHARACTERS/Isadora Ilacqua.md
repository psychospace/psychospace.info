![[âŽ‹ Needs Rewrite]]
**Isadora Ilacqua** is the oldest daughter of the Levin Family. Growing up, she always showed an aptitude for cooking, just like her father.

She was always the boss of the Levin children and has a strong protective streak. She expects her siblings to always listen to her, which they rarely do. She frequently jokes around but can be very focused and serious when needed. She is currently second in command at The Horseshoe and is learning the business from her parents so she can one day take over.

Married to [[Adinah Ilacqua]]. She uses Ilacqua as her surname most of the time, but uses Levin in professional contexts, such as with [[The Horseshoe|the restaurant]].

Sister to [[Eldral Levin]]. As of [[1251 PT]], she is 32, same as her wife.
