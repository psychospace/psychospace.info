**Ink**, also known as Ink of Angelblood, is a [[Deathlock]] allied with the [[Nortian Conspiracy]].
# History

This [[Curse|cursed]] [[Undead]] found itself in the employ of the Nortian Imperial Magic Research Operations Division ([[NIMROD]]) while they were poring over the notes of the old mage [[Viers Callinan]]. The warlock was first slain by [[Stoneshaper Ethel]], the legendary swordsmith, who was apparently coerced by the warlock's dark power into forging a pact weapon and signing away his soul. Then, the undead was cursed by the mages of Shinedown, trapping its undead soul in eternal sunlight.

As part of the Conspiracy, Ink works to spread the embrace of revenge and self-driven madness.

Like all of the Conspirators, Ink normally wears the [[Cloak of Excelsio]].

Ink wields the *[[Life Line]].*
