**Anti**, also called the **Ignition Point**, is a [[Divinity|divine]] known throughout [[the Heavens]], who serves as [highest god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_gods) in most pantheons which feature it. 

Within the [[Pantheon of Dawndust]], the Ignition Point is held as the progenitor of the [[Divinity|pantheon]], the authorship of the [[Divine Equation]], the architect of [[the Planet]], and speaker of the [[Golden Voice]].

It is the foundational "genetic" origin figure of all deities in modern worship. Strictly speaking, Anti's [[domain]] is beginnings, creation, and leadership, though it also held the power of [[fire]], which is said to be what enabled its efforts. It is the purported parent of [[Athemat]].

# History

At the end of the [[War of Chaos]], [[The Maker]] fused with [[The Unmaker]]: two halves that were at war with one another for incoherent, lost reasons. When this being, of both creation and destruction, departed this land into the [[Chartless Sea|unfathomed beyond]] whence it came, Anti was its [[echo]] (sometimes described as its "shell") which remained in the world.

At the dawn of the [[Age of the Gods]], Anti's job was to [[‚óç The World Born in Stone|carve the planet and its inhabitants]] from what remained, to give vessels and [[Body|bodies]] to what concepts remained, just as its creator had.

It is said to have begun by anchoring [[chaos]] and [[gravity]] to the [[First City]]. In the course of this effort, it is said to have divided itself, typically into other divines but sometimes into various [[Immortal|immortals]]. 

Eventually, Anti took over [[Kibangan]], carving out [[Welkin]] from it. Its influence has, afterwards, primarily been given to its descendants, though Anti does appear to continue to respond to calls for its aid.
