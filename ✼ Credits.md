# Author & Curator
**January April November** (*ae/aer*, *she/her*) is an author, game developer, and weirdo who is the original creator, primary writer, and curator of the absolute-nonsense paracosm that is [[The Heavens]]. If a page isn't listed in the [[#Contributors]] list, ae probably made it.

She is the Gamemaster behind [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]], [[⍟ Extra Innings]], and [[⍟ Twin Fantasy]].

# Contributors

 Though I can't assure every contributor is compensated, contributions are credited accordingly below.

## Players
As players in tabletop roleplaying, they are as much contributors to the world and how it ends up taking shape as any. The players are listed below along with the characters they control/controlled.

Players also contribute to this world by adding detail and character to unilluminated parts of it, sometimes directly, and sometimes indirectly.

### Pre-MMT
Multiple concepts originated from before the world itself existed. 

Credit is owed to:
- all of the players of *Graffiti & Golems*
    - which inspired the characters, stories, and backstories of [[Critical Hit]]
- the people who played in *Glory to Nascia*
    - which inspired [[The Unfortunate]]
- and the people who bore with me in *Flight of the Knife*
    - which inspired [[Special Task Force Undergarden]].

Had I never had each of those experiences, I would not be the writer I am today. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
