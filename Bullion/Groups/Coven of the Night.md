The **Coven of the Night** is the largest known [[Witchcraft|witch]] coven in [[the Heavens]], with members across most [[Remnant|remnants]] and even in many alternate [[Plane|planes]]. In the [[Mer de Vide]], their modern activities are primarily found in [[Bullion]], where they were founded some six millennia ago.

When the average citizen pictures a witch coven, they are probably picturing the Coven of the Night; when they picture a witch, they are probably picturing someone who is or was a member of the Coven. It is the Coven's [[#reputation|association]] with femininity that has led to the assumption by many that "witch" is particularly a femme-gendered term.

# Ideology  / Structure
Its original and perpetual goal is to kindle interest in witchcraft, discredit the views of those who demonize it, and rediscover magical secrets that were once lost. Despite these goals seeming agreeable enough, their lengthy history has resulted in a variety of relationships with other factions.

While the academies of the world take a more measured approach to understanding [[Magic|magic]], the Coven of the Night centers around self-expression through the craft. They teach that magic is an aspect of oneself that must be understood to be controlled, rather than an external force to subjugated. 

## Reputation
 The coven is open to all creeds and all genders, but due to its embrace of femininity and a disdain for patriarchal institutions, it tends to attract mostly women and people of undetermined or unfixed gender, such as [[Changeling#Axial changeling|maylings]].
 
 The Coven have been at the forefront of many magical discoveries and rediscoveries throughout its history, though their efforts are rarely credited.

>The coven is often denigrated as being a "sex cult", as one [[8th century PT|eighth century]] [[Wizardry|wizard]] put it, especially given it's name's [unintentional connotations](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/woman_of_the_night). However, the acts of love both sexual and non-sexual they're infamous for, including someone serving as a romantic partner's [[familiar]], are merely something which some members enjoy as a pastime and benefit of the job rather than being anywhere close to the group's *modus operandi*. 

The group's reputation and scope has led to witchcraft in general seeing rises and falls in acceptability, especially in cultures which see their tenets differently.

# History
It was originally founded in the [[Bullion#Fourth Era|early fourth era]] of [[Bullion]], by Lady [[Tralas Falwaekian]], an apprentice of [[Maedil Rysae]]. It was the Coven that rediscovered the [[Gift of Stars]]'s docile nature, after the [[Os'Grun|fall]] of [[Ith'Paraan]] caused knowledge of that nature to vanish into oblivion.
