The **Age of Adventurers** is the current[^1] cultural-informal epoch of the [[The Heavens|Heavens]]' greater [[âœ¼ Timeline|history]], specifically originating from the [[Mer de Vide]] in [[1216 PT]].

It began after the advent of [[Critical Hit]], their [[Gravity & Geneses|journey to open]] the [[Vault of Foretelling]], and the subsequent repealing of the [[Ban of Ignoble Conduct]] in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] and similar pieces of law throughout the [[remnant|remnants]]. The cultural movement began thanks in large part to the spread of the writings of [[Termis Tungol]] by the multinational [[Drumlin Publishing Company]].

# Effects
The Age of Adventurers, as its name entails, saw the greater recognition of stateless mercenaries and investigators as both valid roles to fill in society and ideals to aspire to. This broadly reduced the need for specialized policing forces or individual steps of bureaucratic approval to deal with threats such as monsters. 

Primarily, this led to a further rise of adventuring parties, not seen since the early [[Age of Mortals]]. Though adventurers remained litigated about, they were given greater autonomy and the culture around them had cleared up rapidly.
