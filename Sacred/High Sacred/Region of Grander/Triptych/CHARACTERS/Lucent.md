**Lucent Amia** is a [[visitant]] of [[Linnaeus Dino|Linnaeus]], created prior to the [[Dragonic War]]. During the conflict, he assisted the [[S4]] in collecting [[Ikabod Caruso]], and continued to look into his origin and shared connection to his original. 

He has carved out a living as a private investigator, acting as a reliable ally to his fellow visitants and [[The Runts]]. He was originally made of Linnie's paladin oath to protect the crown and the future.
# History

Crafted from the prince's sense of dedication, he was [[Ikabod Caruso]]'s fifth creation for the purpose of curing the [[Dragonic Curse]], deemed a failure. 

During the [[Red Spark]], their unconscious body fled the [[Ivan's Tiger|Ivan's Tiger]] and traveled to [[Triptych]]. There, he quickly became a talented private investigator, troubled by his lack of memories, his resemblance to the prince, and the unrest settling in the city. He eventually was contacted by [[Hikawera]] and [[The Runts]] who were on the hunt watching out for his creator, hiding within the Ioyon Consulate underneath [[Anatt City Library]].

When the [[S4]] arrived and pursued Ikabod to [[the End of the Line]], Lucent was there to aid them.
## Current Affairs
After Ikabod was retrieved by the S4, Lucent returned with the Runts to [[Drastic]], acting as muscle on a team which Lucent could see was lacking it. He remained distant to the S4, though he also assisted in the final battles of the S4 through the use of the [[Catclaw|visitant dagger]].
# Personality
Lucent's personality can be described as tough and heroic, gruff and to-the-point, but also deeply caring and emotionally strong. He often speaks in short sentences, but will mouth off when necessary or emotionally provoked. He views his fellow visitants as siblings, and dedicates himself to any end in which swift justice and a heavy sword can make a proper difference.

# Appearance
Lucent's appearance is that almost of Linnaeus, when he was 20, though with a much different stature and tougher facial features. Compared to the other visitants, he almost resembles a masculine older brother. His long red hair is often tied up in a bun, and his facial hair is kept tastefully trimmed and proper.
