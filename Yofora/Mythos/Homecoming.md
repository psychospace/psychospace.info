***Homecoming*** is the name given to the heirloom [[Firearm]] of the [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] [[Nortian imperial family|imperial line]], starting with [[Serena Nortia]]. Named by [[Uforia]] herself, it is a *rifle-axe* custom fit for the [[Successor (Nortia)|Successor]], and acts as her weapon of choice.

*Homecoming* is a magic rifle-axe powered by compressed air. Its method of firing, using pumped air to propel projectiles, heavily limits its use by anyone who lacks the same [[Ekaitz|control over storm]].

*Homecoming* was built as a commemorative birthright for lady Serena, its name signifying a new addition to the line of monists.

The weapon has a lengthy inscription in [[Oa'Rovi]], reading "*Rav'ithflas / Paraan'i Qua'por*", or "Portal of Tumult Fog / For our Motherland."
