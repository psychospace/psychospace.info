**Lakeside** is a calm town residing near the [[Wishing Aspen]], bordering on the [[Grand Watersea]]. A predominantly religion-based town, it was founded early in the [[Kingdom of Sacred|Kingdom]]'s history for its proximity to angelic ruins.

Gods here are so heavily worshipped that faith has become similar to loyalty to sports teams.

# History
Many years ago a green [[Dragon]], Vaportail, took root in a fallen manor in the Wishing Aspen, and it grew pleasure in subjugating the hamlet where the Iron-Heart monastery existed. It took the efforts of the monastery, as well as champions of [[Prus]], to oust the dragon and send it elsewhere. The champions, who were from Toride, requested that Lakeside train further champions of their name and faith, and, barring that, if the dragon ever returned to that manor, that the champions would take the next child born there and do it themselves, for this was the path and divine chain of justice. This is what ended up happening to [[Boldin Iron-Heart]].
