# History
He was born in [[1108 PT]].

He is part of a guild known as the [[Twilight Walk Guild]]. He, his parents, and his sister were all very well-known figures in the guild. His other family members were all powerful casters, but for some reason his ancestral powers were never able awaken inside of him. He felt like he was a disappointment to his family and decided to run off and leave the guild and his family behind. 

He honed his skills under the mentorship of someone named [[Valain Stalwart]], a high-ranking member of an underground crime network known as the [[Spider's Web]]. He learned the ways of being a rogue and the ways of deception during his time there... unfortunately this did not last long, he eventually heard word that the crime network was after his sister, [[Melia Hawthorne]].

He took it upon himself to try and stop this by killing the head of his branch, [[Solaria Evercleave]]. Since then he's been on the run from the crime network, adopting several different personas and disguises throughout his journey. All he wants more than anything is to protect his sister, and to prove he can be someone without the crutch of his family name.

He most recently joined up with the [[S4]] in [[Midzone]].
