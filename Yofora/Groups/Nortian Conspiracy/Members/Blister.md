**Blister** is a [[goblin]] artificer who is allied with [[Nortian Conspiracy|the Conspiracy]], and member of [[Special Task Force Undergarden]]. Once allied with a dwarven settlement, Blister intentionally caused an explosion to embed a [[Mana]] crystal in his hand to see what lessons might be learned from such an experience.

Like all of the Conspirators, Blister normally wears the [[Cloak of Excelsio]].

Blister wields the *Oblitera*, a powerful prosthetic arm capable of wielding a charged dark gemstone — a [[Destruction Catalyst]] — carving anything and everything with long tunnel-like explosions, gathering what it destroys as [[Alchemy|alchemical]] strength for use in equivalent exchange.
