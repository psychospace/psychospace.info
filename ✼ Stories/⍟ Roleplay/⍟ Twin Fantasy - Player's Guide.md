This page is a **player's guide** for the backstory and content of [[⍟ Twin Fantasy]].

>[!important]
For details on a particular topic, read through pages linked to [[⎋ 2FPG]].
# Backstory
Before you read on, it is recommended that you read the prose below, which acts as an introduction to the state of affairs in Twin Fantasy's timeline (if you haven't already).

![[⊛ Change is In the Air]]

## A World In Motion
Thirty-four years ago, a [[Dragonic War|war]] was briefly fought between the [[Nortian Conspiracy|puppet-government]] of [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] and the curse-laden armies of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]]. 

The people likely to be your family were scarcely called into service by their alliances with either side, when an event called [[Zero Day]] resulted in [[the Planet]], the world of [[Skysea|skyseas]], changing irrevocably, abruptly bringing the conflict to a screeching halt.  Though few understood the breadth and depth of what exactly had transpired, the [[Sky-scrape|scars in the sky]] above them wouldn't let them forget: their future, in the long-term, was highly uncertain, just like the tyrant [[Illarion Parasom|Illarion]] spoke of.

Many predicted that something drastic was long due. The [[omen|omens]] of the conflict were many, after all. But few were ready, especially in hindsight. Shortly after the close of the conflict, once-in-a-lifetime weather began to assail the realms. In Bullion, that was the [[Great Hurricane]].

## A World Seeking Answers
With the shifting of previously impervious magical systems, rediscovery of vanished planes, strange shadows manifesting all around, and novel "[[New Magic|new-magic]]"  causing more and more mayhem year after year, the everyday citizens of the world seem to be in turmoil without name.

In spite of all the danger, there are always fresh winds of hope. 

The thirty-year peace has held, replete with miracles of trade and development. Treasures of empires long gone have seen a meteoric rise in relevance of late. The technology produced in the wake of the war, in communication, transportation, and mechanization, has been sweeping the world city by city for decades. 

The remnants are transforming day by day, and nobody can claim to know what their final shape will be. The world has had need of heroes all the while, for all sorts of novel excursions.

But all too certain is the gnawing voice: the thought in the back of the mind, amidst tales of newborn gods and dead realities, that **the best is yet to come...** 

...and so arises the need for common cause.

# Character Creation
Your characters are one of a number of brave souls from throughout the [[Mer de Vide]], emerging during a tumultuous moment in the [[Age of Adventurers]]. 

Over the course of your travels, you will make new friends and meet old, amid the many threats that this era poses. In traveling the wide-open prairies of Bullion, you will unravel mysteries and mysterious forces, investigating and solving problems episodically as the Planet continues to turn outside of the everyday job of [[Wildwalker|wildwalkers]] like yourselves.

In *Twin Fantasy*, **you, the players, are in charge of where you head, what strikes your fancy, what sides you will take, who you will trust, where you will stay, and ultimately, what fates lie in store for you.** 

**This time, you [[shotcaller|call the shots]].**

## Motivations
Though you all likely have many goals in your life, for one reason or another, the start of the game sees you all uniting under one common mystery, forming an adventuring party. You, like so many others, have been roped into the hype around the rumor of '[[Empty Lake]]', an urban legend of a community safe, entirely, from the changing world. 

As the linked article describes, the legendary ratfolk cowboy [[Halmer Kraig]] apparently retired to the Lake, something that drew an incredible amount of attention to what was, at first, a relatively small rumor. Though the Saint's words later reduced the frenzy to small pockets of curiosity at a time, you remain intrigued.

Regardless of reasons, Empty Lake's existence (or lack thereof) and its legend can be blamed for pushing you from ordinary work and quiet ways of life, to aspire to something greater. 

* You may have heard of it, like many, from circulated gazettes which reached your town or city. 
* Or, maybe you're already interested in the occult or new-magic adjacent studies, and the idea of a place where the "new normal" doesn't apply strikes you as a fascination. 
* Or, in your studies at one of the [[Institutes of Bullion]], you might've had your curiosity piqued by a rumor that appeared to be fact, what with the Saint of the Fifth apparently warning against it, and secured permission to research it.
* Or, you may be yourself a product of magic you hardly understand, and want to find a place where your innermost purity and innocence is apparently allowed to thrive, free of this madness.
* Or, your life may have been forever harmed or helped by new magic's proliferation and "[[altercation|glitchy]]" tendencies, in any myriad horrific way, be it years or weeks ago^[(or in *the future* or *never at all,* in the worst cases)] — and like so many others, you want what you've been told is an *escape* from that.
* Or, you might just be a person with a good sense of adventure, and this new mystery of '*what happened to my [21st-most] favorite writer?*' has got you going.

No matter what, on the fifth day of the sixth month of 1285 PT, amid a muggy, hot summer in middle Bullion — you are a tourist to the town of [[Fournier]]. The article contains much more information.

Maybe you're based in this town and are looking for work. The [[train]] north from here's spotty — maybe you got stranded there? Maybe you wanted to see the caves. Maybe you wanted to see what's going on around town — what kind of bones are being thrown to novice adventurers. Maybe you needed partnership, or just needed friends. In this day and age, nobody wins by being a lone wolf.

But, as soon you'd find, something isn't quite right about the town. What that is will have to wait...



## Limitations
Bullion is an incredibly diverse remnant, and the changes brought in both by the epoch shift and the Age of Adventurers as a whole mean that almost the entire slew of Pathfinder 2e character types and archetypes are at your disposal. 

Don't make a "bad" player character — they should be able to cooperate with others. It also would help if your character has reasons to be absent, if they need to be.

Please consult me (January) if you have questions about what is allowed. 

## Regions
Here are some examples of regions in Bullion your character may be from.

>- **The Northern Limit**: A mountainous tundra in the northeast untouched by most industrialization, where the native beastkin populations of [[Naciente]], inside the legendary First Forest, are promised safety from aggression. The mountains almost resemble rising walls cradling them. The predominant power of the Northern Limit is the [[League of Joriele]].
>- **[[Aed & Maed]]** (pronounced like "aid and maid"): The [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]] seat their power in the highlands, flanked on all sides by grassy plains where farms and small townships reign. This large region is where your adventure begins, northwest of [[Eleyda]].
>- **Reyezuela**: A gorgeous golden volcanic region marked with ruins and vast chilly forests, once blown apart by a [[Os'Grun|meteor impact]] and then torn asunder by the [[Bullion Civil War]]. It is now home to the [[Protectorate of Winifreyad]], and one of the most premiere intellectual centers of the remnant in the [[Fifth Institute]], who play a vital role in controlling the epidemic of new-magic. 
>- **The Cracked Sea**: These islands (and the nearest place on the main landmass), broken off in the wake of the apocalyptic impact event, harbor fascinating cultures and even more fascinating rewards for the intrepid explorer
>- **[[Kernwelt]]**: The lower center of the landmass is home to dwarvish and other tunneler folk inside dusty mesas and clay villages, such as the harengon of the [[Siella Valley]]. Underground here are vast networks of complex ruins with a vast history, which has led to a culture of survivalists and explorers who brave them. Push further south and you'll reach [[Sirrhad]], a conglomeration of cities united by commerce and freedom of expression.


# ~~Format*~~
Many have asked what the "format" of the campaign will be. This campaign will be much more open-ended than how I initially planned [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]], something approaching a hybrid of traditional formats and [West-Marches](https://www.secretsofthebarrowmaze.com/what-is-a-west-marches-campaign/), to hopefully partly address issues I ran into while running campaign 1.

**Update 2-16-2024:** This format has been scrapped, but I will leave it up for transparency's sake.

- There will be three "core" group members. 
    - At least one member should attend each session. 
    - The core will act as a throughline for the party, "party leaders" in a rough sense, and therefore should share notes regularly with the whole collective.
    - The core group will consist of Chris, Sam, and Ryan.
- All other players are "roster" members. 
    - I'd like there to be a roster of around seven, though obviously in a format like this that number could be much larger.
- The maximum size of any one group will be five members, composed of both core and roster players.
    - Players may join or leave the adventures as desired, or as their players' real-world schedules permit.
- At the end of a week in-game, a "newspaper" will detail how the world and the factions in it are changing, as well as how the party is affecting things.
- The players decide what leads to investigate, where they would like to go next, what factions they are interested in, almost everything.
    - Players are encouraged to collaborate on notes and planning, or explain where their characters have been in the interim.
    - Whenever the players are solid on where to go, next session will likely cover it (or something that happens on the way).

\* This whole format is very **tentative**; you may offer suggestions as needed.
