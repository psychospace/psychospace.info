**Einon Stadium** was a coliseum in the [[Drastic#Olympia Quarter (S)|Olympia Quarter]] of [[Drastic]], used by [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]]'s royals to hold sports, games, and ceremonies. It was named for the first recorded [[Sacred Royal Officiant]], [[Ataska Einon]]. This coliseum was the first location attacked by [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] at [[Red Spark|the end]] of [[1250 PT]] and left in poor condition throughout the [[Dragonic War]]. 

Following the [[Zero Day|retrieval]] of [[Lazuli Dino]], the stadium was donated to the public trust. Lazuli dedicated the site to become a monument for the victims and losses of the siege and the war at large, including [[Ildy]]. Through this dedication, [[Rinzal]] was born.
