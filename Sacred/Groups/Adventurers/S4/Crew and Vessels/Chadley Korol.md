**Shadorokov Korol**, better known as **Chadley**, was a [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] [[Anlage|goliath]] captain of the *[[Sun Chaser]]* who was briefly an ally of the [[S4]] during the [[Dragonic War]].

# History

He and his sister, [[Alcina Korol]], were to inherit the entirety of the Korol estate in [[New Orc City]]. The Korol estate was a large and grand estate that had vast numbers of guards, riches, and fine things. However, Chadley was only interested in the alcohol, weights, and food. His sister obviously was given the full estate and Chadley was given the outhouse and the *Sun Chaser*. Alcina kept him around mostly to act as her personal bodyguard.

Shadorokov, as with many sons of the Korol estate in [[Uznavat]], grew up enamored with entering the empress' service. Shadorokov was once disillusioned with a somewhat childish desire he had for joining the [[War of the Masters]] and by the time it was over, he still wanted to "fight in the next war". After all, the best way to prove you are worthy of respect is to make it so the Lord of Law would know your own name. Alcina had a head start as, with her strength and not-meager brains, she was becoming attendant to high ranking nobility in Novo Orkrengrad ([[New Orc City]]) and thus had access to some of the most private rooms in all [[Yofora]]. 

Among the nobility was young Lady [[Serena Nortia|Serena Vostok Lusyza Nortia]], daughter of the empress and heir to Nortia's future, who had already selected a [[Hazel Sobol|strong-willed girl]] to guard her, of similar age to herself: only twenty but still built like a house, with red hair and green eyes. But she, a die-hard for the empire, had a way of testing people. 

Alcina knew of Hazel, and in [[1229 PT]] took Chadley with her when Hazel arrived one night in New Orc City. The three of them went out for drinks. Hazel heard of Chad's ambitions, and, softened by drink, said hers were greater: to bed Lady Serena herself. Chadley had sent his retainers away for the evening, and thus him and Alcina were the only to hear of this drunken confession. Shadorokov, ever blustering, felt that Hazel had wronged Serena's honor, despite the fact that he knew nothing of her (or how difficult it was to pull this knightess aside from work for a night).

Chadley eventually set out with his few retainers he had to travel the world aboard the *Sun Chaser*. He got around by working for other people to do odd jobs, since there are very few jobs a 9-foot-tall goliath barbarian can’t solve. He got his iconic lumberjack axe during his wandering.

In [[1250 PT]], he ended up in [[High Sacred]] a few weeks before the start of the war, meeting [[Lurana Moonswallow]] at the [[Oldwall Pub]]. Following their meeting, he was at [[Drastic]] during the attack and attempted to save as many lives as possible. Ever since he’s been helping clean-up crews and has commanded any of his retainers to do the same.

He eventually was contacted by the S4, who were invested in rescuing Lurana. With tbem, he embarked into the [[Chahi Decade Reserve]] and saved the old fighter.
