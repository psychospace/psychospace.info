The **Pitcher**, also known as the *pallid figure*, is an entity of currently unknown description. They were the subject of many [[Confluence|conflux]] events between [[Vitality energy|positive]] and [[Void energy|negative energy]] in mid-[[1249 PT]], including a miraculous one in which many people were revived. Their existence was also connected to the [[Base (XI)|Bases]] in an unknown way.

Their existence and effect on the world is the subject of *[[⍟ Extra Innings]]*.
# Appearance
Its appearance is of a young, pale-skinned humanoid of indeterminate ancestry, unknown gender, and unknown corporeality. Their clothes appeared at first to be white, though after the events at the First Base, apparently gained some detail. 

For some reason, it is extremely hard to look them in the eye. 
# Personality
At first, their persona seemed to be incredibly confused and confusing, often stating cryptic passages and making allusions to [[skitball]]. With the destruction of the various Bases, they began to understand more of their history, and became more aware of themself.

The Pitcher reacted by apparently emotionally demanifesting when confronted with the possibility of being contained and studied by the [[Daily Grind]].
# History

According to an [[ambrotype]] collected at the corrupted [[Estelis Ranch]] in the [[Upper Kernwelt]], they were a friend to [[Ciro Enfys]], pictured in [[Regina Steppe]] in [[1243 PT]]. They enjoyed playing skitball, though their name was apparently removed.

On the Ides of Vire in 1249, an event occurred in which they apparently [[Mass-Resurrection Incident|revived dozens of people]] who had died in the last year.
