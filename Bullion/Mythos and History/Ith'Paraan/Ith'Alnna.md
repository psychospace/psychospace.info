The **Ith'Alnna** Project ([[Oa'Rovi]] for **Exultation of Storm**) was a cultural effort of the people of [[Ith'Paraan]] to conquer the stars. They wished to bring their whole society to defy the limitations of [[the Heavens]] and surpass the [[Divinity|gods]].

It was initially envisioned as their final rite of passage to escape [[The Planet|Yalagnu]] using [[Void breaker|void breakers]], with hopes of conquering some planet beyond the [[Antic Sea]]. 

In the end, the name became synonymous with their catastrophic failure, as the fulfillment of [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto|Amakudari]]'s [[Amakudari's phantom|Promise]], among other missteps, resulted in two centuries of turmoil, plague, and nightmare.
