A **Nail** is a general term for any [[Firearm||firearm]] cartridge used in [[Blast Gun||blast guns]] which operate like [shaped charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaped_charge). They are composed mainly of a cone of metal backed with a large amount of explosive material. When set off, the explosion deforms the front metal cone into a pointed "nail" which is simultaneously ejected out. Due to the nature of their operation, they can only be used in close to point-blank ranges. Beyond that, the projectile fishtails and loses most of its penetrating power. 

Nails generally refer to purpose-made rounds for blast guns, but there are also some that are self-contained made in smaller, standardized cartridge sizes. These can be used in small arms such as the [[RDM-8]], sacrificing range and precision for stopping power.
