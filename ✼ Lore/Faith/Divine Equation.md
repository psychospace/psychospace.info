The **Divine Equation** is a theoretically-infinite, inconceivable equation that governs and oversees all rules of reality as it exists in [[The Heavens]], written in the [[Golden Voice]] of its authors, the [[divinity]]. All [[magic]] falls under its guidelines.

Its base element is the force called [[logic]]. The limits of the Equation are kept in check by the [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]]. The only creatures that can fathom all of the infinite Equation are, in essence, the gods who created it in the first place.

# Composition
Though it is widely known as the *Divine Equation*, it also shares properties with adjacent concepts, such as algorithms and programs. The Equation is ultimately the term for the arbitrating force distinguishing between potentiality and possibility within the [[Antic Sea]].

It is impossible for any mortal to fully [[psychic code|comprehend]] any meaningfully-lengthy tract of the equation. Thus, magic is an attempt to access its natural laws *ad-hoc*, and thus affect reality. Until the [[Zero Day|advent]] of [[Psion|psions]], the natural conclusion of this was represented by the [[wish]] spell.

Like degrees and radians in the real world, the measurements by which each faith or school of magic generally wield the Equation vary by 'unit': for the goddess [[Cientia]], for example, this unit would be “time”, as this is her [[domain]].
