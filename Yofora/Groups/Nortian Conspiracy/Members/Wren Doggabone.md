**Wren "The Wrench" Doggabone** was a [[Nortian Conspiracy|conspirator]], Ranked IVth in the organization. One of the key figures in [[NIMROD]] as of the [[Dragonic War]], Wren fought in the bleakest of battles and develops the cruelest of schemes so her son, Erde, can live to see a conflict free world. Wren is Rank S in Section Four of NIMROD, marking her the division's leader.

# History

Once, she had fought as an internal spy, seeking the truths of [[Orkrengrad]] alongside her romantic partner, [[Jaziel Agarrmura]]. With him, she mothered a [[Kobold]] son, [[Erde]]. 

In [[1236 PT]], one of her longer expeditions into the lost city, after witnessing something truly horrifying, she was burned by some malefic force and left for dead. Although scarred over most of her body, and her soul's true status unknown, the tireless work of [[Ortensia Howards]], brilliant bionicist, was able to resurrect her as half-machine in [[1241 PT]]. Over time she came to embrace the artificial parts of herself, undertaking the legendary title and nickname of "The Wrench".

With many a year of training and adventuring under her boots already, even being gravely injured once wasn't enough for her. She began to crave pain, sinking deeper and deeper into research on soul magics and the power of darkness. Her curved greatsword, eternally upgraded and morphed, became known throughout the land as the legendary Nine Lives Stealer, capable of ripping souls from people with a single swing.

She became a master of weapons and magic, in every sense of the words, even though she had become something far different than simply human by the time she had risen to maximum rank within NIMROD, commanding her own armada. Her history, seeking to go beyond the limits of what the Empire would allow her, is what led [[Illarion Parasom|Illarion]] to coerce her to his side.

Like all of the Conspirators, Wren normally wears the [[Cloak of Excelsio]].

Her flagship, the *[[Great Kraken]]*, is effectively her home now. Erde lives in [[New Orc City]].
