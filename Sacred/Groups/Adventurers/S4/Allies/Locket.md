**Locket** is a [[Visitant]] of [[Linnaeus Dino]], created by [[Ikabod Caruso]].

Crafted from the prince's sense of creativity, she was Ikabod's sixth creation for the purpose of curing the [[Dragonic Curse]], and was the first to be marked a success.

Her soul was bound to Ikabod's through the [[Lifeblinding|mark of lifeblind]]. During [[Red Spark]], she fled Drastic with Ikabod.

Locket is a creative soul, enjoying writing.
