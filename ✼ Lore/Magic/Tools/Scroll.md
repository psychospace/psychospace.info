A **scroll** is a [[Spell]] written down on special vellum in arcane ink, in nearly raw [[Psychic code]]. Upon use, it usually burns up as an additional [[Tribute]] cost. Scrolls are often large, and stored carefully in arcane libraries. 

Scrolls often contain more information than just the spell itself, such as necessary groundwork to facilitate copying the spell down. Examples include miscellaneous minor equations, root spells, or research notes.

A scroll allows you access to the knowledge needed to cast a spell, but you must still be able to fulfill every other requirement of that spell. Due to the instability of casting raw code, without fully burdening your mind with the memory of a spell, the scroll will be consumed by the active runes on the page.

A scroll can generally be copied into a [[spellbook]], in a user-specific form, when discovered.
