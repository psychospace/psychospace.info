**Maccus Shoichet^[(shoy-ket)] Integra** is [[Gilda Integra]] and [[Shohei Integra]]'s father. He fled Nortia after the end of the [[War of the Masters]], along with Kazumi, fearing that the Empire would soon monopolize and control their research.



His field of research is that of animating machines with simple programming, and crafting industrial grade factory equipment.
