**Imagi** is the god of [[Illithid|mind flayers]] and is at least in some part an [[Out There|Old One]]. 

Imagi presides over many [[Aberration|aberrations]], and constantly plots to convince the universe that its love is the truest love in the world, although its plots are extremely convoluted and even a little twisted sometimes. Overall, its [[domain]] is an embrace of light and dark powers as a balance of the soul. [[Kuo-toa]] are believed to be its creations, and its deceit of [[Dwarf#Duergar|duergar]] has long caused their schism from the whole.
