A **ghost** is a form of [[undead]] which had its [[soul]] continue to live after its [[body]] [[Death|died]]. Usually due to strong [[Echo|emotional attachment]] to the world of the living, specifically in the moments leading up to death, a ghost often binds itself to a location, waiting for a new body to take over. 

A ghost can also form when a soul accidentally drifts from a body without having something to tether it home.

Due to the variance in ways it can form and manifest, ghosts take a variety of shapes and conjure a variety of abilities depending on when, where, and how its body died. Ghosts leave an intriguing potion ingredient behind when attempting to cross psychospace to the physical realm and back again, known as ectoplasm.

Ghosts can't usually be created artificially, except by replicating scenarios on accident.

Logistically, a ghost is a [[Creature#Whatsit|whatsit]].
