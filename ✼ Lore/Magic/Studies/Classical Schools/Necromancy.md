**Necromancy** is the [[Magic]] study of **necromancers**, and is one of the eight [[Classical Schools]] of magic, interlinked with [[Transmutation]]. Necromancy is the study of entropy and the reversal or slowing of its effects, especially as they pertain to [[Creature|creatures]]. This is achieved through the manipulation of both [[Vitality energy|positive]] and [[Void energy|negative energy]], the raw forces of life and death.

Traditionally, necromancy is viewed as an anathematic practice, acting as a persistent ignorance of [[Death]] as a construct, usually involving the creation of [[Undead]] or subversion of other tenets of the life domain. However, many applications of necromancy are great boons such as [[Resurrection]], its ultimate study.

Necromancers generally reanimate the deceased bodies of others by reattaching the disconnected [[Echo|echo]] to it.

Necromancy has a bad reputation in many places in [[The Heavens]], especially those places touched by [[Angel|angels]]. It is believed to be predominantly anathematic to the worship of many [[Divinity|gods]]: their oversight over [[Mana (plane)|Arcadia]], wellspring of life, holds the connotation that denying the cycle of rebirth is "against the divine plan".

## Positive
The [[Great Nortian Empire]] is known for experimenting with undead. Generally speaking, undead in Nortia are created out of those whose slight against the empress could not be forgiven, or people like [[Hazel Sobol]] who were looking for a way to dedicate themselves entirely to her.
