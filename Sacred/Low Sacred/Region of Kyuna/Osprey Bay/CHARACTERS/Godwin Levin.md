**Godwin Deiha Levin** is the father of [[Eldral Levin]].

Once a chef for a minor noble in [[High Sacred]], Godwin Deiha moved to [[Osprey Bay]] because he wanted to escape manor life. After meeting [[Annette Levin]], they dated for 3 years before marriage. With her keen business sense, they opened [[The Horseshoe]], Osprey Bay's premiere gourmet restaurant. Godwin is a generally laid-back man who takes great pride in his cooking. He deeply loves his family and wants what's best for them but can be a little judgmental at times.

He really wanted one of his sons to be a great warrior but has come to terms with the fact that neither will. He is very proud of [[Selah Levin]] for becoming an instructor at the swordfighting academy.

Godwin is 60.
