**Quori** is a term for a powerful massive [[Soul]] that harbors a distinct desire to aid the living against the horrors of the [[Death|dead]] and nightmares.

A good quori is known as a *domovoy*: vanguards of sleep, protectors of dreams and powerful forces in terms of magic and fate. Bad quori are known as *sirin*: controlling, manipulative, and immensely knowledgeable world-changing pawns of the gods and otherwise.

These quori go on to inhabit and bond with mortals to create *[[Kalashtar]]*.
