A **total psychospace kill**, or **TPK** for short, is a potential [[Collapse state|collapse]] scenario for the [[The Heavens|Heavens]] in which [[Psychospace|psychospace]] vanishes. 

The potential for this was first observed secondhand by [[Viers Callinan]] inside the [[Elseworld|crashed world]]. Once the TPK occurs, the remains of psychospace become known as [[Necrospace|necrospace]].

# Effects

A lack of psychospace as an interface for [[Soul|souls]] would also cause all [[Remnant|remnants]] to lose their [[Gravity|orbit]] and crash down to [[The Below|the Below]], and all known [[magic|magic]] to fail. 

This doesn't necessarily preclude the ability for external sources of subversion of natural laws, such as via any [[Outsider|Outsiders]] or other [[Manifold Seas|manifold]] systems, to influence a universe in which TPK has occurred. 

# Etymology
The term itself was coined by [[NIMROD]] when poring over Callinan's notes, a translation of a [[Mänyya]] phrasing he was fond of invoking when describing his journeys into Elseworld (less-accurately translated as "*absolute death of the mind*").
