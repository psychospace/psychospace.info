In arcane terms, a **familiar spirit** or **thrall** is a [[Magic|magical]] companion to a caster, shouldering the weight of that caster's anchored power through a [[Soul bond|soul bond]]. They are commonly associated with [[Witchcraft|witches]] and [[Wizardry|wizards]].

# Purposes
The purpose of enlisting a familiar is fundamentally twofold. The first is to obtain a stronger link to [[psychospace]], one which can't be easily broken nor risk their own [[silver cord]], granting sharper insight to one's own [[Viewpoint property|viewpoint]]. The second is to create a "third-person" viewpoint, a portable channel for both [[enchantment]] magic and one's perception.

# Familiarship
Ancient lore describes familiars as artificial [[Fylgja|fylgjur]]. The term can refer to a summoned [[figment|figment]], though technically, any [[Creature|creature]] may become thrall to a caster given the right conditions, though the process usually requires the utmost of mutual trust. 

For example, in [[Witchcraft|witchcraft]], a familiar may be provided as part of the [[Gift (witchcraft)]] they are granted, or, in some rare cases, a romantic partner may undertake the role.

## Summoned forms
Popular summoned forms of familiars include [[cat|cats]], [[Bird|birds]], and [[frog|frogs]].
