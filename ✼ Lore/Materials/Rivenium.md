**Rivenium** is a magical material, said to be the physical form of dreams, particularly when in excess crafted by certain powerful dreamers, initially the [[Divinity|gods]] themselves. If it is impure, it may turn instead into [[Hepatizon]].

Although rivenium no longer exists in abundance, dreamers capable of creating rivenium today still include a number of entities, especially creatures that are masters or rulers of huge realms, such as [[Uforia]].

# Properties
Anything crafted with it holds the power to channel, in a pure form, psychic energy, although it is so brittle and rare that no one would ever mold it into a weapon without some deeper thought to a plan.

It is comparable to [[platinum piece|platinum]] in terms of worth, when alchemical use is taken into effect. It is a primeval, useful material for enchantment, although with the density of something like ceramic.

While its use is rare, it is used more often when considering materials designed to disguise and respond to a host's mental whim in enchantment, as the metal oft attunes to psychic commands.  

Alloys of rivenium are called *riven*, as is anything made with it. The most well-known of these is *riven steel,* which evades *[[identify]]* and *[[detect magic]]*.
