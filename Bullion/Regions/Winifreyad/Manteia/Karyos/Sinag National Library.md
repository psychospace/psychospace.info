The **Sinag National Library** is a national library of [[The Shibboleth]] which is in [[Karyos]].

It is a core treasure of [[Bullion]] as a whole, but is particularly a treasure of [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Winifreyad]] in specific. It is a collection, public and private, of over a millennia of knowledge from all over, though most of it comes from within Bullion herself. 

It is named for a [[Sinag Massif|specific]] [shield volcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield_volcano) in the [[Upper Kernwelt]], where the first archaeological inquiries into the ancient societies of [[Holrfold]] bore fruit.
