Many times throughout history, creatures have attempted to rise to the [[immortal]] level of the [[Divinity]] through the discovery of a **Mortal God [[Ritual]]**. Many figures throughout the [[âœ¼ Timeline Hub|history of the world]] are known to have spent their entire lives seeking a way to "become immortal", although few if any successes can be truly proven. 

The [[Accidental God]] is thought to be one such exception, but since Cailean rose to divine status through a medium that is now [[Viewpoint property#Detriments|effectively impossible]], alternative methods continue to be sought out.
