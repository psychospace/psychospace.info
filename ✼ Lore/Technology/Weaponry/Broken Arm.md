If an [[New Magic#^a0f54b|exnihilated]] object's hazardous properties are able to be harnessed or wielded, such an item is known as a **broken arm** or **BA** (capitalization is subjective).  Such an item earns its humorous name for being a tool or weapon (an "armament") created out of altered, "broken" consequences. ^3516c6

BAs exhibit a wide variety of properties, with new examples discovered frequently. The origins of many broken armaments are hotly debated; the [[Fifth Institute]]'s official stance is that they are likely drawn from alternate [[Worldline|worldlines]], though a large minority of scholars within the institute have differing opinions.

It is atypical for a [[psion]] to fully and inherently understand a broken arm they manifested, although weapons of certain shapes can be intuited easily enough for a skilled individual to make use of them. While such an individual may gain an edge in a fight due to their unorthodox weapon, it may also paint a target on their back; broken arms, like their divine "equivalents" in the [[Lynchpin device|lynchpin devices]], are often sought-after by bounty hunters, mercenaries, assassins, treasure hunters, and weaponsmiths.

# General types
## Monstrous

**Monstrous broken arms** are made not from wood and metal, but from organic material derived from the [[body]] of a ritualistically hunted [[creature]]. By bonding the hunted creature's [[echo]] to the weapon, these weapons manifest some of the traits and abilities of the hunted creature. Monstrous weapons tend to take the form of a handheld [[firearm]], though some exceptions may exist.

After the first monstrous weapons manifested from reality-bends, a rare few individuals discovered how to perform the hunting ritual and subsequent bonding magic, allowing them to create their own monstrous weapons. While this has resulted in the creation of new monstrous weapons *without* the need for a reality-bend, monstrous weapons manifested from a reality-bend are near-universally made from creatures not found within any known part of [[the Heavens]], making them impossible to replicate.
## High-Tech

Certain broken armaments exhibit a wide range of makes and models that vaguely resemble modern forms of weaponry, though nearly all are composed of a myriad of metal alloys and are wholly incompatible with any permanent form of enhancement derived from [[magic]]. Despite their rejection of [[Psychospace|psychospacial]] influence, **high-tech BAs** frequently evoke energies normally inaccessible except via magic (such as [[void energy]]) and easily bypass defenses. 

High-technological weapons can include but are not limited to:
- [[Firearm|Firearms]] which project energy, fire rapidly, and/or attack in relatively large areas compared to the size and weight of the weapon
- Bombs with high explosive or implosive yield relative to the size, weight, and chemical makeup of the bomb
- Melee weapons which rely on stable projections of energy or complex moving parts
- Cannons of [[airship]]-scale or larger which can easily pierce, melt, pulverize, or otherwise trivialize thick walls or hull plating

High-tech BAs are among the beneficial creations of [[new magic]] researched by the [[Institutes of Bullion]].
## Sapient

**Sapient BAs** may at first appear to be non-anomalous, but through unknown means have acquired their own intellect. Most sapient weapons possess a myriad of anomalous properties in addition to sapience, such as the ability to use Cast Magic or influencing the mind and/or Body of their wielder.

Sapient weapons may be able to communicate in a number of ways, such as by speaking out loud, [[telepathy]], projecting words onto a surface, or even by sharing emotions; sapient weapons generally prefer to communicate with the one wielding them, though they may be able to communicate with others as well. Some sapient weapons claim to have their own [[Soul|souls]] or [[domain|domains]], but these claims are difficult to verify. 

Like any intelligent being, sapient broken armaments have their own agendas. Wielders of sapient weapons are often forced to negotiate with the weapon to use its power, if the weapon is willing to aid its wielder at all. Some intelligent weapons are parasitic, leeching life force or magical energy from the wielder. Some are even known to outright possess the wielder, forcing a battle of wills; wielders who permanently lose this battle have their bodies warped and partially merged with their weapon, becoming an unnatural host.
