The **Mansion of Keys** is the mysterious base of operations for the [[City & Castle]] guard in [[Drastic]]. It acts as the guardhouse of the city, and is a sort of sprawling villa with royal blue rooftops located on and near the city walls. 

There are no visitors to this mansion, and low-level guards operate primarily locally (only taken to the Mansion through teleportation), so no one really knows what the inside looks like, but many theories are linked to the way in which the guard shows up to city disturbances; that is to say, by walking out of rectangular blue "doors" that appear out of thin air, disgorging squads of guards to combat criminal activity. The "keys" in the Mansion's name are rumored to be what allows their instantaneous transport throughout the city.

The doors are generated by a teleport field which surrounds Drastic, supported by 5 beacons suspended atop 5 towers, one of which being the [[Tower of Electron]].
