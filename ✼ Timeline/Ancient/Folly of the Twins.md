The **Folly of the Twins** is an origin myth, taking place during the [[Age of the Gods]], important to both [[Dwarf|dwarvenkind]] and [[Goblin|goblinoids]]. In this myth, twins [[Calcula]] and [[Bioh]] were warring over their domains as [[Divinity|divines]], each believing that their means of fostering growth and forward progress was better and more necessary than the other.

# Mythos
Without a clear voice manifesting from ever-stillborn [[Exponen]], the future of civilization seemed unclear, and so these other deities, still nascent themselves, decided to step in to offer a guiding hand and determine civilization's fate.

To settle the score, Calcula and Bioh both took the form of [[Dragon#Astral|astral dragons]] who lived on opposing moons over [[The Planet|Yalagnu]]: little more than aggregations of rocks that were used for raw materials in the [[◍ The World Born in Stone|recreation of the world]]. The gods, though, were fickle and observing the growth of the [[First Magicians]] at the same time, and would thus spend their time and effort trying to cheat the task out to lesser creatures which they manifested from their scales. 

The siblings asked for a neutral divine arbitrator for their contest, and, after great deliberation, [[Ravus]] stepped up to the position. Being the overseer of the [[Dark Sea]], the night mother decided to play a trick on the children of the [[Cientia|light goddess]], and decided the contest should be improbable. 

## The Contest
The deciding challenge would be the rigor of creating eleven "impossible objects": Bioh through life and evolution, and Calcula through material construction. Ravus had counted on this task being unlikely, as the longer the two squabbled, the more energy that the moons would gain, and the more significant that Ravus's [[domain]] would become.

The creatures they manifested, called **tholes**, had mixed properties, some of clay, some of rock, some of wood, and some of pure metal: possessing the hardiness, constitution, and strength of trueborn dragons, but without a body structure that would facilitate flight.

Whenever the tholes would attempt and fail to create anything resembling the impossible objects required, the dragons would callously toss them down to [[The Planet|The Planet]] below. 

Hundreds of scales they molted and grew, and yet again and again the tholes would fail and be thrown down to the mortal realms, sometimes before even being given a fair shot. Most fell directly to [[The Below]], but some became entangled in the various [[Elemental creatures|elemental]] domains which were taking shape, including the [[Scarlet Skies]].

## Success and Results
Eventually, two of these tholes succeeded in Ravus's task, astounding even the Midnight Scouring. Calcula's champion was named **[[Lex|Eriva]]** and Bioh's champion was named **[[Ordo|Tegra]]**. 

Eriva's creations were eternal walls and powerful weapons which could thwart any opposition, able to enforce any rule that Calcula wished. Meanwhile, Tegra's tactic was to look at Eriva's work, copy it, and improve it in simplistic, but educational ways: if Eriva made a hammer, Tegra would make one twice as large, and twice as unwieldy.

Eriva was astounded that anyone could replicate, let alone make improvements on, her designs for the impossible objects. Meanwhile, Tegra was personally astounded at Eriva's dedication to completing the task without any means of interacting with, let alone collaborating with or tricking, her opponents.

As rewards for this prospect, finding that both the sisters' domains were necessary for reality to flourish — both ego and hubris in tandem — Eriva and Tegra were elevated to godhood. Meanwhile, upon the planet, Calcula's children evolved into [[Dwarf|dwarves]], and Bioh's children evolved into [[goblin|goblins]].

Over time, the now-divine Eriva and Tegra would divest themselves of the creations made as part of this contest, turning them into moondrops which would birth [[Harengon|harengons]].
