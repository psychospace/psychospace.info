An **immortal** [[Creature|creature]] is one which is exempt from the permanence of [[Death|death]], as opposed to mortal creatures. Immortals have [[Domain|domains]] which bind them to specific aspects of nature, instead of to a [[Soul|soul]].

Immortals often possess powers leaps and bounds over mortalkind. Mortal and immortal blood is compatible in ways which defy natural science, forming creatures known as [[scion|scions]]. 

# Properties
Broadly speaking, nearly all immortals can be categorized as either [[Divinity|divine]], [[Celestial|celestial]], [[fiend]], or [[monitor]], with many [[fey]] also categorizable as immortal. Immortals are usually bonded to one another by type or clause, so these types operate almost as superorganisms. 

Immortals are never born: they are always directly created (a process called "definition") by other forces or circumstances, such as other immortals, rare severe [[Altercation|altercations]], or natural laws. For example, a horrific sinner turned into a [[petitioner]] might be raised into a [[demon]] in accordance with their sin. 

# Personalities
Comparatively, immortal beings are often more closed off than mortal counterparts, and use their immense power and time to manifest great places of sanctitude for themselves (for example, [[Kibangan]]). Some mortal speculators believe this to be because of an existence of a [[Mortal God Ritual]] that the immortals are attempting to conceal or protect. Others believe that immortals may see themselves more as influences on the mortal world, and thus do not wish to abuse their power, out of veneration of their domain.

Every immortal knows that mortals, no matter how exquisite or motivated, are ultimately not a threat to them, though they still have their domain to uphold and often pass judgement for that reason alone. When immortal beings are defeated or "killed" by mortals, they only appear to be defeated. The domain, now liberated, might later replace or rejuvenate the body at a safe distance. However, it may also simply abandon the pursuit which got its body destroyed in the first place.

The only thing that can destroy an immortal for good is a [[Wish|wish]], so any caster which finds their way harried by immortal beings prefers to explore alternative methods of dealing with their judgement, such as through using [[Silver piece|silver]] or sometimes an [[Exorcism|exorcism]].
