A **cantrip** is a minor [[spell]], usually comprised of a single "word" of [[psychic code]]. They are of the lowest possible [[Arcane complexity|complexity]], often possessing negligible [[tribute]]. 

Though they are easy to learn, they are typically signifiers of greater strength in a caster, due to their ease-of-use and degrees of freedom to "freestyle" their effects and intentions. More and more spectacular effects can be incorporated into a cantrip's use, through the caster's growth over time.

# Etymology
The term "cantrip" originates from an truncated [[Arckan]] phrase from the verse of [[Bioh]], [[Hymn of the First Ones]], referring to the first [[Witchcraft|witch]]'s [[Gift (witchcraft)|Gift]]. "silent song to forces beyond, sung by the moon sans any tune", illustrating its ease for the person so gifted. The individual term is translated more directly as "[phoneme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme)".
