**Melotte** are a conglomerate [[divinity|godform]] comprised of seven Zodiacs, also called the "Silent Seven", the "Pleiades", or the "Divine Constellation". 

The [[domain]] of Melotte is that of [[Soul|souls]], children, reform, astrology, and stealth, based on an ancient belief that each [[Star|star]] represents another world with its own connection to [[Mana (plane)|Mana]]. If somebody dies before their [[Logic|fate]] is resolved, or if a [[petitioner]] dies, they are said to return to Melotte, who will then [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]] them until the child achieves their fate.

Due to its near ubiquitous guidance over stars, Melotte is sometimes believed to not be entirely of this pantheon, though myths exist which describe it as created by the gods of this pantheon. It is also said that Melotte's collation of stars was handed to it after a previous god lost the privilege of that domain.

This trickster godform acts as the subject of worship of the [[Trickster's Children]] in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]].

# Altership
The god is plural, and thus "Melotte" refers alone to the constellation as a whole, while the Zodiacs are each "headmate" of the god.

The Seven Zodiacs are:
-   **Maiyyn** - the First Zodiac, also called the Weight of the World. Represents duty.
-   **Lectran** - the Second Zodiac, also called the Living Light. Represents piety.
-   **Taygen** - the Third Zodiac, also called the Fatemother. Represents guidance.
-   **Alcyon** - the Fourth Zodiac, also called the Murmur of the Waters. Represents wisdom.
-   **Celean** - the Fifth Zodiac, also called the Eye Unblinking. Represents darkness.
-   **Steropen** - the Sixth Zodiac, also called the Spirit of Sky. Represents resolution.
-   **Merophen** - the Seventh Zodiac, also called All-Is-Still. Represents peacetime.
