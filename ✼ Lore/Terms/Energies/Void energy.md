**Void energy**, also called **negative energy** or **necrotic energy**, is a type of [[Magic|magical]] energy which can channel the power of entropy and [[Death]]. It is associated with [[Psychospace|psychospacial]] [[Light (property)#Darkness|Darkness]], which it powerfully channels.

It supposedly originates from the [[Kibangan|firmament]]'s influence, and is opposed by its polar opposite, [[Vitality energy]]. Void energy only harms the living, and animates [[Undead|Undead]].
