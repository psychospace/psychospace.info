Also called "The Grandfather Drake", **Athemat** is the [[Divinity|god]] of [[Soul|souls]], reality, and balance, acting as son of [[Anti]]. He is usually regarded as the patriarch of the pantheon. He is represented symbolically by a massive [[Dragon]] of all colors, its scales prismatic in nature.

Its very first child was [[Arizhmiya]], which earned Athemat the notice of its "father". Its first set of divine children were [[Prus]], [[Mynos]], and [[Exponen]], and eventually [[Renthe]].
