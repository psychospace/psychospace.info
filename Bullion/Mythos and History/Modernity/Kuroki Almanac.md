The **Kuroki Almanac** is an [almanac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac) created by the [[Kuroki Keiichi]], which contains information on [[Bullion]] for the regular purposes of travelers, farmers, and laborers. First published in [[1132 PT]], it has been regularly published biennially since, with the most recent being released in [[1284 PT]].

The Kuroki Almanac is seen by many traditional *[[Wildwalker|gauchos]]* as a reliable and persistent companion, able to help predict [[weather]] patterns or [[airship|pteronautic]] conditions based on the region. Certain events contemporary to the almanacs are often included for the purpose of entertaining and informing its users of local traditions and current concerns, marking older editions of the almanac useful as historical documents as well.

The almanacs are typically authored by consensus, with the whole of the nomadic Keiichi contributing to its knowledge, and the sect's [[Kuroki|leader]] contributing to the foreword and meteorological sections.
