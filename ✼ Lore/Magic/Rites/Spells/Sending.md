***Sending*** is a [[Spell]] of middling [[Arcane complexity|complexity]].

Using this spell, one can convey up to 25 words to another [[Soul]] across great distances through [[Psychospace]]. That soul can then, near-instantly, communicate with the caster in a similar manner.

This 25-word limit exists in [[Shindani]] and most other modern languages, with similar restrictions for languages that do not use words in the same fashion: so you can't, say, use [[Draconic]] or [[Oa'Rovi|Primordial]] to condense your message further.

# Use
*Sending* is a relatively ancient spell found in most studies of magic. It has been more or less unchanged since it was invented, partly due to the circumstances in which it might be used. According to [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] texts, attempts to use this spell to communicate from the Wild Blue to the [[Dark Sea]] failed. Also, attempts to increase the number of words results in information being lost, which is more harmful than helpful in ideal scenarios.

## Sending stones
*Sending stones* also exist, which are items that can use this spell once a day, recharging using passive [[Vibe]].
