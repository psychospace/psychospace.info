**Zathia** is the frail [[eidolon|eidolon]] of [[Wisfer]]. She is so frail due to persistent [[Light (property)|Lightlessness]]. She seeks to protect her people and their knowledge, although her hope wanes by the day. She would happily defeat evil, if it didn't seem so insurmountable. Her symbol is a key.
