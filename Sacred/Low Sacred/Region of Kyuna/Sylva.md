**Sylva** was an ancient citystate near to modern-day [[Pendulum]] who constructed [[Atlan]]. It was a sanctuary for creatures such as [[Elf|elves]], centaurs, and other [[Fey]].

They were ruled by a court known as the Seelie.

Its name is the source of the common term [[Sylvan]], as well as [[sylph]].
