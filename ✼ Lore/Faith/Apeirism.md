**Apeirism** (*ah-peer-is-em*) is a religious belief that, put simply, the more gods that are worshipped, the better. This stems from an extrapolation of divine protection: ideally, if more gods are protecting the things and people around you, the more protected you are in a sort of divine safety net.

It is derived from the term "apeiro-", meaning "infinite".

It is a novel concept only coming about in the last 200 years or so (as of [[1251 PT]]), and has been studied by divine scientists. However, tangential beliefs have been practiced for around a thousand years.
