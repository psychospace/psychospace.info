**Noemite**^[Pronounced [no-ehm-ight], or [nohm-ight], depending on accent] is a precious metal which possesses unique resonant qualities. 

A tough material which must be worked at high temperatures, it is most well known for its utility in creating [[Verlan|verlanic]] energy, as it forms the basic component of typical [[dust tunnel|dust tunnels]]. 

As a commodity, noemite and noemite mining has grown in importance as leytech has become more lucrative.

# Mining

Noemite veins is predominantly sourced from the [[V채r채h]], where it is plentiful, following its [[Zero Day|reemergence]]. Cubic veins of noemite can be found throughout the planet in lower quantities, as well as have been regularly found in [[the Below]] for centuries.

Mining noemite is considered extremely difficult when compared to other minerals, due to the necessity of [[Airship#Supraekeic|supraekeic airships]] to survive regular changes in pressure caused by such a journey.

# Physical properties

In its pure form, it occurs in distinctive [cubic-crystalline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system) structures, resembling [pyrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrite). 

When worked in metallurgy, noemite is resistant to [annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(materials_science)), and the edges of its cubic crystals typically remain as distinct square "flows" upon the surface of the material, even after its symmetries have been reworked multiple times.

Individual nodes of noemite harbor the ability to sustain a personal, [[Psionics|psychokinetic]], [[Gravity|gravitational]] field, which allows them to hover in arrangement when suffused by the shape of the ambient [[phoreus field]]. Individual nodes are also able to alter their alignment and fixed-height in accordance with directed [[Off-wave|off-waves]] in its environment.

Noemite's most noteworthy properties arise from its interaction with [[Echo|echoes]], which attune and adhere to the metal. Echoes can be transported using noemite as a medium, via physical resonance (usually through contact and vibrations) in other nodes. These properties form the extreme basis of its ability to transmit [[verlan]].

Noemite can be alloyed to produce a [teflon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene)-like plastic polymer known as ***emanite***.
