>[!question|ttl-c subt]- _"Congratulations, umbrellas exist."_ Gameplay may not be accurate to lore
>While many elements of the Heavens are designed around or inspired by game systems, such as Pathfinder or D&D, the world is [[âœ¼ Wiki Principles|intended]] to not prefer any one specific system. The existence of something in one system does not necessarily imply that it exists in the Heavens; and conversely, the non-existence of something in one system doesn't imply that it doesn't exist in the world. For this reason, gameplay descriptions *may* not be accurate to actual intent or lore.
