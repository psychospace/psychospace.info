The Crownshield and Royal Aegis, **Cefal** is a mutant magician who defends the queen and king of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]] at all hours of the day. She is *de facto* leader of the [[Dino Airstyle]], the faction she originally belonged to. She oversees the day-to-day activities of [[Union Keep]]. Once a [[House Burgitsk|Burgitsk]] half-[[Elf]], she shunted her family name when she became a mutant through a difficult trial. By blood, she is aunt of [[Mistral Taylor Burgitsk]].

She wields the Binary Star, a mace with two levitating heads that can defend the user or become a massive greathammer.

Her lower half is liquid metal, capable of taking any form she imagines. Usually, it is either two spike-like legs (for most situations) or a centipede like lower half (for combat).
