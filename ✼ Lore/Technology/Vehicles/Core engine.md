**Core engines**, or simply **cores**, are the [[Psychospace|psychospacially]]-interfacing projection engines that power modern [[Airship|airships]] and [[train|trains]]. In the modern day these are made of [[Quasidragon|quasidragons]], though originally they were produced with actual [[dragon]] souls. 

Most airships use at cores to provide lift, stability, thrust force, and efficient steering. The core, when activated, extends broad wings outward, their color and function dependent on the "color" of the [[soul]] used to craft it. Heavier ships usually require additional mechanisms for lift, or additional cores to provide forward momentum.
# History
The creation of cores and the modern-day air travel began with [[Dawndust]], who discovered the process of creating cores using real dragons in [[BPT 50]], leading to their [[Scaled Purge]]. Their gnomish engineers eventually discovered a means of creating quasidragons using their [[Gray Waters]] without needing a sacrifice, leading to the rise of the airship around the [[1st century PT|turn of the epoch]].

[[Dawndust]] became the first major civilization to become [[Skysea|Skysea]]-faring as a direct result, often trading their vessels in exchange for diplomatic favor. 

Over time, other similar natural resources (such as those found in the heart of [[Pendulum]] in [[Low Sacred]]) were found to be able to create cores throughout the world.

# Function
 To summarize a core's job, it has three duties.
 
1) It keeps the ship's helm connected to mechanical components, suffusing both with magic, allowing the ship to levitate.
2) It projects and controls the hard-light wings which give a ship forward power.
3) At critical levels, its levitating properties prevent the ship from sinking too quickly, in the effort of enhancing a vessel's safety.
