*Wondrous item, rare, requires attunement*

This animated set of dentures, created from a [[troll]] dominated by another troll, enables the user to possess a similar ability when attuned to its mutant [[Magic]]. The teeth needn't be worn. It possesses a hatred for things that would bring harm to the troll, and is capable of warping space in the weapons it consumes in order to reduce the damage that comes to it, similar to how its Regeneration trait functions.

While attuned, the user's teeth do not rot (although they still become unclean) and always regrow when lost from battle in 1d4 days. In addition, the user gains the ability to tear "flesh" out of a non-magic weapon, causing it to become weaker temporarily. 

This damage can break weapons, and can be done an unlimited amount of times per weapon. You have advantage on this attack roll if the weapon isn't currently being used (if it's on the character's back, for example). You can't use this action if you're frightened of the wielder. If you have multiple attacks, this action replaces one of them. You gain no nourishment from this action, but you can "consume" the piece you take out of the weapon.

To detect magic, this item gives off *necromancy* magic.
