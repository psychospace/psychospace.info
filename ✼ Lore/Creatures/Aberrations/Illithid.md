**Illithids**, commonly called **mind flayers**, are an [[Aberration|aberrant]], alien race of tentacle-faced, intelligent creatures which form powerful colonies and exact schemes upon [[The Heavens]]. Illithids concoct strange experiments and largely aim to leverage the [[magic|magic]] systems of this planet to their own ends. They are a classical mythological influence, and are often the target of the ire of adventuring parties.

They scorn [[Divinity|divine]] forces, save for [[Imagi]] (said to be a divine they created), for they have long believe their minds were entirely [[Calamity of the Eyes|ruined]] by [[Bioh]], who rejected these alien influences on the planet. Without the secrets they lost in [[The Gathering|The Gathering]], they have no ability to leave this planet, stranded and embarassed by those gods.

Some illithids, like [[Noella]], have long since come to terms with their status, remaining in an uneasy, unlikely tension with mortalkind.
