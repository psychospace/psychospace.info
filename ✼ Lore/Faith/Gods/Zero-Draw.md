The **Zero-Draw Rule** is a principle of nature. 

If a [[Divinity|god]] has absolutely nobody who believes in them, they will be reduced to a vulnerable creature, [[immortal]] yet without a [[Fylgja|fylgja]], and so unable to reach [[Mana (plane)|Mana]]. This figure, the immortal form of a [[Petitioner]], would be trapped on the [[Wild Blue Yonder]] until either faith in them returns or a [[Psychopomp]] recognizes them. Until that time, if it eventually does occur, they are offered no protection or direction for their status.

Very few gods have ever been temporarily or permanently subject to this rule, an extrapolation of [[psychospace]]'s bond to [[Welkin]] through [[Unwri]]. Gods that approach this rule often go through many different variations prior to breaching the rule, as the influence of a single individual on a faith becomes more and more dramatic.
