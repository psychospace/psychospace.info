In the context of [[magic]], **logic**, or **fate**, is the term used to describe chance and potential, as manifestations of cause and effect.  Logic, read by [[Divination|diviners]], is best defined as [[Chaos]] "making a decision".  Along with chaos and [[Gravity]], it forms one of several fundamental forces of [[The Heavens]].

# Principles

Logic is a measurable, cogent force for change, and it can often something that is being understood more and more. It is otherwise invisible, implacable, untouchable and inconceivable.

This force acts invisibly yet persistently in [[psychospace]], driven by chaos, nurtured by [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality), and informed by free will. 

Logic is often called the base element of the [[Divine Equation]], and breaching it or invalidating prior steps in it can cause severe [[Curse|curses]] to come about. By its existence, logic is the conspiracy that pulls everything along: if something is meant to happen, it will be logic that, one way or another, makes it so. 

# Guidance of logic
Logic can be manipulated under certain conditions.

Those who can consciously or unconsciously guide logic will find themselves with an inordinate amount of luck. Those who are aware of their binds to the grand motivator (and who can exploit it to their advantage) will consistently find themselves prepared for ongoing events and the tendency of the world, though logic does not necessarily impact the future. 

In addition, those with a lack of a bind to the grand motivator, such as those without a [[fylgja]], will find that they tend to become a point around which other events "orbit".
