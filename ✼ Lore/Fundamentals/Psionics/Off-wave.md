An **off-wave** is a type of [wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave) which exists as a flow of energy or purity in [[psychospace]]. 

It is identifiable by devices which can pick up changes in the properties of [[Vibe]], such as [[lux]] converters. A pattern observed in the creation and termination of off-waves is known as a [[psinomenon]]. 

Many creatures possess [[Magic#Latent|latent magic]] which creates off-waves, such as the song of [[Angel|angels]]. Spontaneous off-waves may be the product of the death of certain [[Figment|figments]], such as [[Eidolon|eidolons]]. 

Due to psychospace both effecting and being affected by the physical world, a single event of massive traumatic significance can cause an off-wave which causes suffering completely unrelated to itself. For example, the [[Red Spark]] could be seen and felt from all across the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], in part due to [[Ildy]]'s death.
