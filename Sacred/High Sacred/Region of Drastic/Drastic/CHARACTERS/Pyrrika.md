![[âŽ‹ Needs Expansion]]
**Pyrrika** is a [[Tiefling]] famed detective. Her virtue name is "**Mayhem**". She remains a member of [[Critical Hit]], but in reserves.

Although Pyrrika could never have known it, her long and storied detective agency would begin with her travels as a wandering blade in search of fun and profit. Having been friends with many of the nobles sons and daughters while she was growing up a street magician / beggar in [[Drastic]], she used these connections to attain property and began to search for an actual job. As it turns out, Critical Hit was just forming, and her leaping into action to save [[Ridd of Chained-Earth|Ridd]] from a gang member gave her their trust.

She currently trains apprentices from a business in Drastic, the [[Eyes Everywhere Detective Agency]], rarely drawing too much attention to herself. Her agency is the largest in [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]], although it remains on the down-low. [[Ruby Reno]] is one of her apprentices.
