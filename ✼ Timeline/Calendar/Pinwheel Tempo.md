**Pinwheel Tempo**, or **PT**, is the calendar standard in [[The Heavens]], invented in [[Pinwheel]]. Most people follow its calendar to determine [[Time|temporal]] alignment. It began in [[0 PT]].

It takes the remnant of Pinwheel one full [[Year (unit)|year]] to complete a rotation. Moreover, this became standardized on Pinwheel itself first due to the impact of [[Giia]], its reverse side, and then spread outwards as Pinwheel's scholars took to the skies and propagated information. 

BPT means *Before Pinwheel Tempo*, naturally. Due to minor epochal alterations in how Pinwheel spins over time, when intercalating ancient dates, a few rounding errors may occur.
