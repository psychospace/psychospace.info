The [[The Abyss|Abyssal]] layer and [[Flipside]] of [[Yofora]], **Tantalus**, is called the “highest layer” of Enitor. 

Bound by the [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]] of air, filled with an endless wind which pulls the entire layer at a direct 45 degree angle to the ground, the plains of Tantalus are filled with partial gates into Enitor as a result of [[The Sheer]]’s influence: sometimes literal doors, other times tears in reality, or holes in the earth. The demons which claim dominion over Tantalus are often meek or insidious, unable to take direct action against incurrences. It is otherwise endless rock and the occasional research station.

It was shut out from influence over the obverse side of Yofora by [[Orkrengrad]].
