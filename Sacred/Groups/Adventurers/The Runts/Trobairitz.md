A genderfluid poet, **Trobairitz** or **Trobi** is a [[Wizardry|wizard]] jackalwere who was once servant to [[Ikabod Caruso]] in [[Rainbow Ridge]] under the name Santo. 


In combat, he wields a [[Broom of stars]], a powerful magic staff once used by the Sacred Royal Custodians, which grants him access to a number of fiery spells for both utility in cleaning up messes and security in beating back his foes.

The name "Trobairitz" comes from the old [[Sylvan]] word for "troubadour", or more literally "wandering composer". It has a femme connotation.

# History

Trobi was once bound by a [[Choker of tuning]] to serve his master unflinchingly with his arrowproof skin. Cursed with deafmuteness from birth, they communicated directly only through [[Telepathy#Contact|contact telepathy]] and non-verbal language.

He was recruited by Ikabod with the promise that the researcher may try and heal his [[curse]], seemingly stemming from a hereditary disease, but Ikabod made little progress in the search for a cure, leading to Trobi's growing frustrations and eventual departure.

Trobi has since left Ikabod, and searches for his own truth and power alongside [[Hikawera]] and [[The Runts]]. His curse was eventually cured rather easily by [[Even Baxly]], but they remain mostly mute due to comfort with non-verbal language.

During his time as Ikabod's maid, he grew protective of the winged lady [[Certain (evangel)|Certain]], one of Ikabod's creations. If given the chance, he would have run as far and as fast as possible with Certain in tow, but that didn't pan out, not until [[Red Spark]] occurred.
