The **avatar of death** is a divine concept, believed by many to explain the permanence of the institution of [[Death]]. An entity appointed as avatar will assist [[Exponen|Nexos]] in facilitating the judgement of the dead at [[Unwri]]. The current avatar is the [[Hare and Hound]].

The term refers to the [[Divinity|"gods"]] who oversee death as a [[domain]], appearing to undergo a sort of cycle, "retiring" and perishing when a great conflict has come to an end. After all, as their cults believe, there is no "god of death", only an avatar, as not even gods can escape entropy. 

An incomplete list of entities from past eras include:
- [[Vorgon'vor]], *earliest known*
- [[Macha]], ancient entity worshipped in the [[Colossal Ocean]]
- [[Sinister]], entity prior to Rea
- [[Rea]],  c. [[11th century PT]] to first half of [[13th century PT]]

# Candidacy
Most recorded avatars were conjured up by energies of the universe to manifest this unjudging and somber custodian, but occasionally creatures have proven a worthy vessel. Whether a material being, [[Elemental creatures|elemental]], or [[celestial]] spirit, these creatures always adopted the emotionless, lifeless demeanor of all Avatars.

It is commonly believed that the active Avatar of Death is either a result of the era they were born from, or were a foretelling of the coming era during their manifestation. Multiple cults believed that the more violent and entropy filled the era was, the more violent and bloodthirsty the avatar would be. While some avatars would only be present during natural disasters or the bloodied battlefields where many lives were ended, the more violent of the Avatars have been recorded as taking part in the slaughters. However, both distinctions played their part silently and emotionlessly.
