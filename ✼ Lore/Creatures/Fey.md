**Fey** are a broad category of [[Creature|creatures]] borne of [[Kibangan]], either within it or its influence. The term is usually associated with [[Elf|elven]] aesthetics and [[magic]], as well as dreams, timelessness, nature, and playfulness.

"Fey magic" is generally considered magic aligned with or aligned along the axioms of [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]].

From inside Kibangan, powerful fey known as **archfey** may influence the world outside.
