An adventuring party of five like-minded [[Changeling|changelings]] (plus their [[goblin]] assistant) who have each offered to support [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]] and work under order of [[Ridd of Chained-Earth]], in exchange for a lightening of their criminal sentences. They operate two airships, *Will*, a frigate (lighter, more maneuverable, meant as a scout ship), and *Testament*, a sloop-of-war (a gunboat).

Their leader is Red-Letter, a master of conversation. Lining behind them are Blue, Yellow, Pink, Green (the goblin), and Black.
