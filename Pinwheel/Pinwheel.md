**Pinwheel** is a [[Remnant]]. As a civilization primarily defined by its association with its [[Flipside]], [[Giia]], it is a nation operating under scholarly interests, as well as studious sorts. It is presently ruled over by the [[Ioyon Dynasty of Gears]].

They are foremost in many science and arcane study fields, which are beliefs challenged by the more faith-based societies of this world. The time system adopted the world over is named for its remnant, which spins in accordance with the seasons, and whose full rotation marks a year "[[Pinwheel Tempo]]" (PT). 

Pinwheel's outskirts are marked by a number of heavily chivalry-based island societies, similar to those in the [[Colossal Ocean]]. 

# History
In ancient years, the outskirt nations of Pinwheel followed a stringent law of pride and love for the natural world, even if their observations of it did disagree, and a kind of scientific faith in the [[Divine Equation]] arose. These native nations have fostered long-standing alliances with the government of Pinwheel's mainland: friendly, though strained and decidedly tacit. 

[[Augen]] and others collectively formed the tradition of [[Pinwheel Tempo]].

## Modern history
During the [[War of the Masters]], Pinwheel was operated by an individual known as [[Xenian]] the Observer, who had joined the war out of promise of the legends of what might have been a united remnant that broke apart to become the Colossal Ocean. It aided [[Dawndust]]'s allies in arming them.

Antebellum, Pinwheel began to shift culturally. Many of their soldiers and nobles had seen, over the years and years of the War, had seen how many in those islands did ally themselves together in native nations as a means of survival. This sentiment began to follow back home: A movement began to integrate the outer islands more faithfully as cities and societies of Pinwheel, while maintaining their sovereignty with the many wraithswords procured in the conflict. 

Many of the islands, which had interacted only when necessary with others, rejected this, and the growing dissent in the major cultural centers of Pinwheel created a vortex that sprouted into [[Siege of Ioyosoco|rebellion]].

The rebellion was hard fought, and many still remember the violence in the streets and many still have unresolved rage or revenge on their minds. The Ioyon Dynasty of Gears, designed to assure everyone a place in the society like cogs in a machine, has formed from the ashes of that conflict.
