A seemingly innocent tailor, the **Dayshine Costumier** conceals a darker secret. While they wish you "always a brighter day ahead", the workers at the costumier, [[The Fold]], gather intel on the many mysterious groups within [[Drastic]] society, and often supply them with items, weapons, or ammunition.

The operator and head designer at Dayshine, **[[Summer Sundress]]**, operates a mysterious thieving operation out of the backroom, which hawks poisons and peddles arms as a manner of shortcuts into the underbelly of the city. Get on Summer's good side, and she'll let you into The Fold, granting you a sort of weekly information stockpile she's collected in Drastic and allowing you to aid her in her thieving runs.

Alternatively, a number of other factions are aware of the tailor's true nature and may steer clear, for they know that many of the things on Dayshine's shelves, purportedly crafted by their finest designers, are in truth stolen from people around the city.
