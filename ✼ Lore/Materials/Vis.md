![[âŽ‹ Needs Rewrite]]
**Vis** is a fluid made of concentrated mashed fruit or plants boiled in a water solution with salt by low level spells such as *produce flame*. Based on well-founded beliefs that nature and life is the basis of [[magic]]'s essence, it acts as a base from which many arcane equations take shape, primarily those concerned with moving power from one place or form to another.

Vis turned into a solid form becomes *vitrissia* (vih-triss-ee-ah), a sort of plant material used in enchanting non-metal items. Vis created by [[Spell|spells]] of higher [[Arcane complexity|complexity]], how few there are, is known as *vysa*, and is used as a premium potion ingredient.

Vis is usually transported or sold in glass jars, and is similar in price to middling quality liquor. An empty vis jar can be reused if cleaned thoroughly.

Oftentimes, spoiled fruit is turned into vis, both to make use of the rotten useless crops and to be sold.
