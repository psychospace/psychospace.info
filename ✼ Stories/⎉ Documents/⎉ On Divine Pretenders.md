“When the [[Blood War]] between [[devil|devils]] and [[demon|demons]] raged, certain landmasses, such as those which would have gravitated to form the [[remnant|remnants]], were tied to the [[Scarlet Skies]] by a ‘*conduit*' of sorts. This ‘conduit' was a necessary precaution for the [[Divinity|gods]] that fought in that war, to assure that their numbers would rarely dwindle in order to overwhelm the competition; the goal of this endeavor seemed to be that the gods of demons and devils would *recycle* [[Soul|souls]], excesses not considered, to replenish their ranks at least 2 (returned) to 3 (deceased). Evidently this stands opposed to the natural order of things in the current times. 

"When a soul of most any creature [[death|dies]], it generally goes to the Skies before it goes anywhere else, sorted out and then sent to its final destination. If that process were to be interrupted, one might be able to change its course, and this is what the gods did: redirect a dead soul's fate, plant it in the soil via this ‘conduit', and ‘water' it with fatal mutation, expediting it to sprout and live again in short order. 

"In no uncertain terms, necromancy seeks to recall a vestige of a soul, using the memories inbuilt to the body of a life lived, to return it to motion. Just the same as the gods' work, it interrupts the processes of [[reincarnation]] and damnation in favor of perpetuation. Is there any question why necromancers are so often said to be ‘divine pretenders'?”
