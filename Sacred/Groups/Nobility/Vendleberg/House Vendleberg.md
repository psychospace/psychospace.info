**House Vendleberg** primarily of [[Beastkin|shifters]] and [[Human|humans]], has offered royal executioners to the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] for over 300 years, since the time of [[Stegos Dino]]. It is rumored (by perhaps fools) that their bloodline traces back to the Chosen of Bioh, [[Basil Falknjir|Basil Rhopalis Vatal Falknjir]]. They operate out of [[Castle Xilan]].

At some point, the house of Vendleberg entered a strong relationship with [[House Nowatzyk]] of the [[Great Nortian Empire]], due to a criminal who had fled to Sacred in order to escape justice. During the lengthy process of tracking this mastermind down, rumored to be the founder of the [[Spider's Web]], the mighty patriarch [[Puma Vendleberg]] (a best friend and executioner under Edmont and Dakouta) consorted with [[Å ablozub Nowatzyk]], Outrider of Yofora and Chief among the Imperial Executor Squadrons (esteemed national monster hunters).

This pairing led to the training and rising of the status of the two in [[940 PT]]. Yezh, their child, is known to be Volk's relative.

The Vendleberg's employers take the form of [[Trickster's Children|masked children]], often two sent to deliver one message. They operate covertly in order to assure that one of your family only operates when ready. The current generation of Vendleberg children know little about them other than that they work as part of the King's secret guard, protecting the country from invisible threats.

The Vendleberg [[House words|words]] are "May death return unto us a life in better faith, evermore."
