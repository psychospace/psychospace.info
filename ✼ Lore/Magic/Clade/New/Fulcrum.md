A **fulcrum** describes a covert [[Magic#Clade|clade]]-like designation given to certain new magicians. It is best likened to a [[Psion|psion]] equivalent of a [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin device]], acting as a significant noted contact point for [[Out There]] and other beings beyond the [[Divinity|divine]].

A fulcrum possesses the psionic potential, inherent or not, to [[Collapse state|end the world]].

The term originated with the [[Fifth Institute]] and the [[Syncretist]] students of [[New Magic|new-magic]], attempting to find a phrase that would best describe certain figures in [[Ith'Paraan]]'s history.

Only seven known living cases (in [[Bullion]] alone) have been designated legitimately as fulcrums, even though others may qualify for the literal definition of one. Importantly, only new-magicians can be called fulcrums — this is not a designation given to entities or monsters.
