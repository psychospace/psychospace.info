The **Red Diamond** was a *[[Superbia-class]]* [[Airship]], used by the [[S4]]. It was captained first by [[Star of the North]], and then by elven explorer [[Fera Illumin]].

She was once captained by [[Archipel|Archipelian]] trade boss [[Jov Redheart]], but, after his death, sat abandoned in the [[Drastic]] seadock for many a year, before seeing use as the escape vessel for the S4 during the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]].

Once a crew for her had been recruited from outside the [[Royal Bladeworks]], the ship would see use over much of their adventure. It was heavily damaged during an incursion against the [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] *[[Hiveling-class]]* *[[Briarey]]*, who ambushed the group on their way back to Drastic at the end of their mission to collect the [[Golorr|Stone of Golorr]]. 

It eventually became a component part of *[[Wings of Dawn]]*.
