The **Golden Voice**, also called the Words Entwined or known formally as *Inilynn*, is the "voice" or language of the authorship of the [[Divinity]], and thus the voice with which the [[Divine Equation]] was written. 

The Voice has immense power over [[Psychospace]], and is used by bardic magic. When its existence was made tangible by the influence of the [[First Magicians]], it eventually led to [[Arckan]].

# Mythos
The [[Anti|Ignition Point]]'s voice was said to be that from an alternate reality, and was given its own name separate from the God of Gods, "*Inilynn*". The words (if they can be called that) that Inilynn spoke to furnish its own creations became resonant throughout them, awaking and [[Echo|echoing]] within all the gods, and throughout the expanse of psychospace.

It is said that primordial [[Chaos]], in the infant years of our [[universe]], is where bardic magic originated as the remains of "spoken" ancient words. This Golden Voice, in lingering words, gave the [[Elemental creatures|elementals]] form and description in a world that lacked any sight, and eventually, when typical existence was cast into three-dimensional shape by [[Kibangan]], the Voice returned meaning, form, and function to the world.

The Golden Voice, entwined with the words of the gods that wandered the [[The Planet|Yalagnu]], became increasingly more powerful, forming new species, knowledge, minds, memory, and magic. It is said, for this reason, that bardic magic may have been the very first kind to have any effect in [[The Heavens]].
