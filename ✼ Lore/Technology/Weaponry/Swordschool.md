'A **swordschool** is a system of martial arts, defensive techniques, and training regimens, typically of a specific group or culture, like a [[noble house]] or chivalrous order. They help inform how a specific "fighting style" takes form. 

A swordschool also typically has a **pinnacle weapon**, a legendary weapon which progenates the style or has served as its best example, reified in a single [[antique]].

Despite the [[Shindani]] name, a swordschool does not necessarily have to do with swords: it is merely descriptive as a curriculum of personal defense. Along with the [[house words]], swordschools are considered points of pride and traditions, and carry with them many connotations of the culture which created them.
