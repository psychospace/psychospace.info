The **Chartless Sea**^[Known less commonly as the **Maelstrom**, the **Origin Point**, **Borderworld**, or **Brink**.], is the [malformed realm](https://2e.aonprd.com/Planes.aspx?ID=19) and origin place of [[Chaos]], in its rawest energetic form. It acts as the origin point of chaoskin, most notably [[protean|proteans]].

It is perhaps the most ancient place in the entire [[universe]], for its power is the basic [[Plane|plane]] which the entirety of the [[Out There]] is architected from.

# Properties
Its physical form is tenuous, but resembles a sea of endless tar that is both ever-growing and ever-approaching from a viewer's perspective. 

The Chartless Sea is the source of universal expansion and thus the endlessness of the [[Out There|Outer Planes]]. Beings within this font of creation cannot easily influence the world that spills forth from it (what chaoskin derisively call the "Structure"). It probably also created [[Kibangan]], though many believe the two came into being in opposition to one another. 

Today, as [[Manifold Seas|the universe]] it birthed has continued to grow, its power has apparently waned.

Voyages inside the Out There, to [[the Heavens]], cannot be traditionally traversed when their reality's laws fade away: it is simply a volume of liminal [[logic]], which acts as a medium to be traversed roughly. These, the "holes" in the [[Manifold Seas]], are known as "**chartless**", yet to be filled by the light of [[Star|stars]]. 

Such volumes are believed to be a raw "reality [gulf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf)" from the Chartless Sea. The spaces are the "absence" of space, reality that is yet to be made whole.

These spaces are believed to be widely governed by the influence of [[Outsider|Outsiders]].
# History
When concerning [[the Planet]], the borderworld's discovery and the madness that emerged led to the [[War of Chaos]]. The Chartless Sea was also the supposed birthplace of both [[the Maker]] and [[the Unmaker]].
