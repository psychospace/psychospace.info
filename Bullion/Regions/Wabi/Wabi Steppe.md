The **Wabi Steppe** or **Cracked Sea** is a geographic region of [[Bullion]], located to the midwest of the remnant, off its coast. 

Though not a traditional [steppe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe) in modern day, the region was, at one time. The land was later rended asunder by being the epicenter of the [[Os'Grun]] impact event, shattered apart supposedly due to over-mining by [[Ith'Paraan]]. Today, it is a minor [[skysea]], a [bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay) locked between the lands of the [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Emirate]] and the lands of the [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Protectorate]].

Also known as **Outer Wabi**, it contains several [[remnant|islets]], politically collected as the [[Wabi Isletary Concordat]]. The four major islets in the archipelago are:
- [[Izani]]
- [[Tralas]]
- [[Mangamma]]
- and [[Isera]]
