**Siglarian**, sometimes known as **Harmonian** or **machine language**, is a system of symbolic languages, used by advanced automata and [[Dust tunnel|leywire]], which acts as a [map](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) between the artificial mind and [[psychospace]]. It is holistically unintelligible to most biological creatures.

Advanced automata must understand Siglarian as necessary for their thoughts to interact with psychospace. Strangely, [[The Signal#^d5cf12|Signalized]] entities, as well as [[Broadcaster|Broadcasters]], also innately understand and respond to it.

# Linguistic design

The language is comprised of a [[logic]]-based machine, not unlike an operating system, that communicates and operates by sending "sigla" (singular: siglum) from unit to unit. Phrases in Siglarian are comprised of states, represented by three-digit [dozenal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodecimal) data, utilizing decimal digits 0-9 as well as X (decimal: 10), Y (11), and Z (12). 

This data can assume any necessary structure, usually determined by the prior states: typical structures include vectors, relation-maps, and strings. Externally this can resemble pure network traffic: a conversation could read "3X0 210 723" responding to "738 29Z 373 291".

Emotionally, the language is as depthful as [[Shindani]], though cloaked in code. A non-automaton could eventually make sense of Siglarian text, but to them, it's almost pure nonsense without some kind of underlying context, like a cipher code.


# Relation to [[the Signal]]
Endless Siglarian-esque numeric strings are produced by the hostile data-streams of [[The Signal|the signal]] through its primary manifestations, without pattern or clear meaning even to Siglarian interpreters. Why the signal does this is unclear, but its secondary manifestations, in nonsense poetry, is possibly related to this linguistic association. 

This is part of the reason the signal interferes with dust networks, as it is interpreted as nonsensical Siglarian by its components.
