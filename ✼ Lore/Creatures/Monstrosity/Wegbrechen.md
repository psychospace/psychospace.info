**Wegbrechen**, also well-known as **breakaway** or **waybroken**, are a sort of [[Changeling]] monstrosity. In the process of revolutionizing a changeling into a [[Doppelganger]], waybroken arise when one significantly resists the experience, but developed the same misanthropy, in effect creating a nested self-identity and "double actualizing".

This unlocks a vile transformation where a breakaway can overpower near anybody by breaking the rules of their own body. In short, they become living time bombs, waiting for people to let their guard down, act without thinking, and display to the breakaway that they do not deserve to live. After meeting a breakaway, a person is seldom able to tell the tale of the body that split apart and ate them with dozens of teeth.

Breakaway are mythologized in [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]], but are very rare elsewhere. The most they are heard of is in borrowed literature found in [[Umazia]]. In Nortia and Umazia, their spread is halted by the [[Imperial Executor Squadron|Imperial Executor Squadrons]].

Rumors say that these creatures were the original form of changelings before being gifted a will, a limit, and a heart by the gods.

# Personality
Breakaway become incredibly conniving, drunk with power over people, knowing that they choose who lives and who dies. In their quest for creating their own environment, they fall in line with the rakshasas, and often work towards similar goals: priding themselves over gaining people's trusts. Breakaways are not a fan of long cons, though, and will often strike and vanish into a new persona, leaving only blood behind, totally devouring the body.

By becoming a breakaway, a changeling innately cuts its lifetime by half, overexerting their body. A changeling can repair the damage done to their psyche through [[Modify memory]] or intentionally magically [[Curse|cursing]] themselves, but they can never regain the time they lose.

Make no mistake, a breakaway still harbors some mortal implications. However, it is often so within its own head that convincing it not to kill you is often not an option at all. In short, its an unchainable beast. If you trust it, it might trust you, so far as you serve its goals and "don't get in the way". Since the creature is so alien in intent, avoiding annoying it is far easier said than done.

# Indicators
A breakaway is often very subtle with its disguise. However, a telltale sign is a trail of blood from the lip down to the chin, or a distinctive cone-like burst of blood at its attack sites.

A breakaway's weakness is ice and slowing of its own processes, as well as shattering the grim, regenerating organ found most often at the basis of its form.
