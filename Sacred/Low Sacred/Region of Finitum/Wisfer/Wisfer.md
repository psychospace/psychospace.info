**Wisfer** is one of the original towns constructed by [[Carapa Republic|Carapaeans]], but a mysterious [[curse]] placed on the land long before they reached it caused the developments there to be minimal. Attempts to revive the town have been met with similar halting of progress.

The edge of this town is a [[phantasm]], allowing half the town to be built over the side of the remnant.

Its [[eidolon]] is [[Zathia]].
