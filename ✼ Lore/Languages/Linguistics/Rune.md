**Runes** are a fixture of various language systems, notably [[Arckan]], which hold a strong influence on [[magic]]. Believed to have been first etched by [[Giant|giantkin]], runes convey powerful meanings that are also at the basis of all [[Spell|spells]].

Many studies which deal with the fundamentals of magic, such as [[Witchcraft|witchcraft]], also toil in runes.
