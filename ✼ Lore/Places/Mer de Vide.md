The **Mer de Vide**, or the **Void Ocean**, is a massively important [[Skysea|skysea]] of the [[Wild Blue Yonder]].

# Sceography
It is bordered: 
- to the north by the [[Mare del Monte]]
- to the west by the [[Colossal Ocean]]
- to the south-west by the [[Shining Sea]] (containing [[Dawndust]], [[Catharia]], and others)
- and to the east by the [[Mer de Andar]].

At its farthest north-west edge is the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], while to the farthest south-east edge is the [[Great Nortian Empire]]. 

As of [[1251 PT]], it took the average [[Airship|airship]] around a [[Month (unit)|month]] to cross the diagonal of the Mer de Vide, though that time can be massively cut down using [[Runic engine|runic engines]].

# Civilization
Widely proselytized by [[Dawndust]], its predominant faith is the [[Pantheon of Dawndust]].

It contains the [[Remnant|remnants]] (and islets therein) of:
- [[High Sacred]]
- [[Low Sacred]]
- [[Yofora]]
- [[Umazia]]
- [[Bullion]]
- [[Archipel]]
- and [[Pinwheel]]. 

# History
The [[War of the Masters]] and the arms race which predated it marked the first time when many forces were collaborating across the vastness of the ocean.
