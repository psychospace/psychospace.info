**Demons** are a family of [[Fiend|fiends]] who are predominantly chaotic evil. Most trace their origin to [[The Abyss|Abyssal]] layers, and most despise [[Devil|devils]] with an ever-burning passion. They are divinely represented by [[Pothesis]]. A group of demons is known as a **throng**.

Demons are by-and-large created by the deaths of sinners, raised to that position by already-existing demon lords, and all demons represent (in one way or another) the destructive power of particular crimes, actions, or attitudes. Unlike devils, demons lack the abilities needed for influencing the living to bring about suffering, and so squeeze all the energy they can from bringing more into the ranks of the dead. 

Lesser demons accrue power from the Abyss by punishing [[petitioner|petitioners]] who fall under their [[Domain]], though all lesser demons are ultimately vassals of greater demons, who can smite them with just a thought. Sometimes, as a passing curiosity, a lesser demon might be allowed to climb over its station, though only by accident does a demon lord allow one to ever reach a power level which might threaten their own authority. ^22fab1
