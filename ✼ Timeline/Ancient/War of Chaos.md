The **War of Chaos**, also called the **Shatter**, was a prehistoric [[âœ¼ Timeline|epoch]] which precipitated the close of the [[Old world|Old world]]. Most of what we know about the War of Chaos originates from records kept in the [[Apocrypha of Winds]], and it helps to give context for why [[the Planet]] today is filled with [[Remnant|remnants]]. 

It was followed by the [[Unknown Era]]. 

# History
In a blind-spot in the utopian society of the old world, an ancient power arose, [[Chaos|what they called magic]], and smashed everything they knew to bits. Apocalypse quickly became a very real possibility. This chaos operated outside anybody's grasp, slowly devouring the world. 

The will to 'undo the progress of society', fed by their magic, caused an immortal and extremely powerful being, [[the Maker]], to arise, to apparently deny the use of magic.

The Maker worked with two Hands, one of destruction and chaos, and one of discovery and creation. The Hands of Maker worked to rebalance the universe, to restore the world, to recreate disorder so conflict, and different wills of mankind, could survive. This was because civilization must not stagnate itself, but it also inevitably can.

At the same time, it was hard for civilization to see the goodness of the Maker. Here was a world on the verge of complete peace, on the verge of absolute happiness, and here, too, arose a being to break it, as though they had not earned it.

Some rebelled against the Maker, but in that rebellion only achieved self-destruction. It was infinitely powerful, and thus any attempts to stop it would be met with complete inevitability. 

It is said that at this time, faced by severe existential terror on two sides, there was a planet-wide split. Some fought for the Maker by accepting its power as the true desire of their gods, the school of "rapturology". These were opposed by a second sect which fought against this inevitability, loath to embrace it, known apocryphally as the school of "rejectionism". Both believed themselves servitors of the good of their civilizations[^1]. The opposing ideals and the stakes of failure lead to a war which engulfed the planet, championed by the ever-burgeoning chaos and the will of the Maker. 

This conflict between the two formed a sort of meta-consciousness opposed to the Maker, only apocryphally known as [[the Unmaker]]. The rejectionists formed and obeyed the Unmaker's will against the rapturologists. It is implied vaguely by the Apocrypha that the two deities became something of a mix of each other: one being mistaken for the other.

Eventually, though, chaos devoured the planet, and there would be no true victor. This plunged what remained into the [[Unknown Era]].

[^1]:  It should be noted that it is unknown which of the two groups compiled the Apocrypha of Winds.
