The **true name** of a creature is an exclusively-unique special word or phrase, spoken into being with the [[Golden Voice]], which is inscribed upon a [[soul]] at birth. Because even [[Figment|figments]] have true names, it is likely that all beings which can perceive the world have one. 

In [[Magic]], the true name is said to possess an inexplicable dominion over a creature's [[Logic|fate]], acting as a [[Psychospace|psychospacial]] "index" to that specific creature, distinct from all others. By invoking it through [[Enchantment|enchantment]], even the mightiest of beings can be subjugated. Learning your true name can reveal a piece of your destiny, and sharing your own true name is seen as placing almost total, unequivocable trust in another.

Almost every creature will never know their own true name, as it is only evoked with research or with spells which compel the reveal. [[Goloma|Golomas]] in specific are terrified of having someone comprehend their true name.
