A significant enough [[Reality-Bending|reality-bend]] results in what is known as an "reality **altercation**" or a "**snapback**", in which some force of [[Universe|reality]] resolves a significant [[Context|conflict]] which has been put in place arbitrarily: a reaction to an alteration.

# Effects
Altercations result in colossal, unpredictable, and unplanned errors, especially to the cause, even further beyond the bend that caused them. Repeated, consistent altercations create [[Haze]], a factor which preaches the caution one must take when tangling with [[New Magic|new-magic]].

Some examples of an altercation's effects include:
* [[Time travel]], for the effect and/or the caster
* A random, catastrophic [[Tribute]] cost
* An error or adjustment in [[Logic]]
* At worst, an altercation might [[Collapse state|end the entire world]].

# Principles
The basis of an altercation is the fundaments of [[Wish]]. No matter what changes are desired to be created, reality (and [[Bias coagulation|souls especially]]) will take the path of least resistance. Even when the consequences seem random, they exist as parleys with the natural state of things.

Witnessing an altercation is described as a surreal and emotionally-difficult experience, as the two realities fight for comprehension. The existence of altercations forms the bedrock of the first rule of [[Witchcraft]]: "Reality may bend, [[⊛ The First Rule|but it will never break]]." 

Altercations are most often attributed to the effect of [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]], but it can occur with any significant enough reaction that attempts to breach the limits of the [[Divine Equation]], such as the [[Zero-Draw]] Rule. 

# History
Originally, altercations went unacknowledged by reality, potentially allowing anything and anyone to rise to [[Mortal God Ritual|godhood]]. To prevent this (except in extraordinary circumstances), the [[Divinity|gods]] created the lynchpins.
