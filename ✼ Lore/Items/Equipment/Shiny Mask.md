The **shiny mask** is a glossy metal mask, said to deny oneself their true identity. It reflects the outside world, and denies that whatever visage it conceals has ever been a part of that world. It became a symbol of [[Heartknock|a particular group]], although its origins remain a mystery. A subtle orchestra of humming is heard by a creature who wears it, inducing a increased focus effect not unlike the effects of binaural beats.

# Effects

The shiny mask is one-size-fits-all, capable of reshaping to match the size and scope of a creature's skull without interrupting use of its traits. A creature wearing this mask hides the perception of their face, although their identity is not altogether concealed. Food phases through the mask if it is eaten by the wearer.

Once placed upon a creature for about an hour, the mask hardens and becomes difficult to remove. After the mask hardens, if the wearer removes their mask, they receive minor lacerations as parts of their face are taken with the mask. They are not injured if the mask is removed by another creature, but they still take damage if the mask is destroyed by blunt force. A creature wearing the mask can't remove the mask from another creature.

The mask absorbs the thoughts & experiences of a creature who wears it: no magic can halt this effect. In other words, as long as you wear the mask, your thoughts and senses aren't secret and are being saved in the psychic fabric of the mask. Certain spells or other creatures may be able to retrieve these thoughts & experiences from the mask.

If any creature wearing the mask dies, the mask snaps into two clean pieces and becomes nonmagical. If this happens, all of the [[Echo|psychic data]] it collected is retained: thoughts in one half, experiences in the other. The mask resists alterations made to it, preventing it from being turned into a unique piece.

A creature wearing the mask cannot be unwillingly targeted by a *[[Sending]]* spell or any spell which requires their name, with potential exceptions. A creature wearing the mask feels it is difficult to reveal their name or history. Even compelled, someone with the mask on is incapable of recalling anything past short-term memory.

Each of these effects end on a creature if the mask is removed. However, if they remove the mask after wearing it for too long, something may be taken that cannot return. Etched into the identity of the item are the words, "One need not the mask if they look only inwards."
