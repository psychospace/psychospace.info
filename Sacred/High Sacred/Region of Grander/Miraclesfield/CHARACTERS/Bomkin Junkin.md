A potioneer, **Bomkin Junkin** is a [[goblin]] hawker who once met [[Volk Vendleberg|Volk]] at [[Feather-Moss Farm]] prior to the events of the Summit, where he had attempted to sell the family there "zombie repellent" fertilizer.

Bomkin was forced to change professions earlier in his life, being born and raised in [[Triptych]], after more skilled elves, orcs, and humans were brought in to the community and could outprice and outsell him.

Bomkin sells many things to those who come across him: things that don't seem useful, but may end up saving your life. After the Summit, he has entered the shady business of war profiteering, hoping to try and sell potions to the many soldiers and guards wandering the city of [[Miraclesfield]].
