**_Gravity & Geneses: The Many Adventures of Modern Heroes “Critical Hit”, Retold by Termis Tungol_**, is a non-fiction book by [[Termis Tungol]] published in late [[1216 PT]] to critical acclaim, compiling many former volumes of the *[[Critical Legends]]* series.

It is a firsthand, if flagrantly dramatized and made child-appropriate, account covering the adventures of [[Critical Hit]] from their exile from [[Drastic]] to their opening the [[Vault of Foretelling]].

## Events of [[Gravity & Geneses]]
While conspiring to enroll in the [[Constellar School]], the nascent adventuring party [[Critical Hit]] befriended two students and members of the [[Somber Troupe of Arcane Research|S.T.A.R.]]. 

These were [[Ikabod Caruso]] and [[Termis Tungol|Travis Tungol]], who granted the party extended access to the grounds, the disused [[Carapa Republic|Carapaean]] tunnels beneath them, and to protection against the [[City & Castle|C&Cs]]. 

The party began to become noteworthy, with their enemies, suspecting various members (correctly) of being nobles, forcing them into fugitive status under the Ignoble Conduct ruling. This forced them out of [[Drastic]] for a two-year period before they could be smuggled back inside, during which their underground popularity and the discontent with the ever-lengthening conflict only grew.  

Around this time, partly from the interest of ally [[Drachedion Balthazar]], the party learned about the [[Golorr|Stone of Golorr]], a strange Carapaean [[Antique|artifact]] which was being tossed like a hot potato around the various criminal enterprises of Drastic and [[The Well]]. The vault the Stone was said to be a key for was further said to contain unimaginable treasure. 

### Return to the Capital
After returning to the capital city in early [[1216 PT]], after intercepting a drug deal for the Stone, the party found themselves quickly on the receiving end of intense attention from authorities. The Stone exchanged information with the party, eventually revealing to the dissidents that there were three difficult-to-obtain keys for the Vault, which itself was inside a tunnel at the edge of the ancient seawalls of Drastic.

Using the Constellar tunnels, Critical Hit found the vault and brought the mysterious keys to it, fighting off kidnappers of the stone all the while. Eventually, they had fought so thoroughly that they eliminated the [[Khakkurihn]], a [[beholder]] mob boss of the Well who had long troubled the royal guard. 

The party was able to trick the old enchantments asking for the horn of a [[unicorn|unicorn]] by bringing it a children's plush toy of the mythical creature, which acted as the final key to the vault. With the Stone in hand, the door to the massive [[Vault of Foretelling]] opened, revealing a 750,000 [[Gold piece|gold]] trove of wealth, which they planned to keep all to themselves.

### Deal with the King
At this time, the criminality of their acts caught up with them, and the [[Dino Airstyle]] tracked the group down to the [[Oldwall Pub]] where the party was based. There, the king [[Hadro Dino]] made a personal visit and offered a trade: half the treasure in exchange for Critical Hit's names being cleared, and all the fame and fortune that would definitively come their way.

After deliberation, the party agreed to the King's deal, becoming legends and war heroes for discovering the funds that could broker a peace and bring the war to a close. 

# Cultural Impact
Tungol initially published *Critical Legends* 1-15, which this book is a re-edited compilation of, in secret due to the [[Ban of Ignoble Conduct]]. *Gravity & Geneses* was published in late [[1216 PT]] where it immediately saw success, with many enamored by the exciting adventures and twists and turns. Some, especially on foreign remnants, were not even aware that the story was a work of non-fiction.

This work and those which followed it, especially following the repeal of the Ban, cumulatively, caused a massive cultural movement to emerge, which became known as the [[Age of Adventurers]].
