![[⎊ Hazel's Arrival#^6d35df]]


Also known as the **Siege of Drastic**, the **Red Spark** was a major incident between the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] and the [[Great Nortian Empire]], which came to be known as the introduction and first battle of the [[Dragonic War]].

# Events
On the Third of [[Augenschein]], [[1250 PT]], the Summit of Sacred was to occur in [[Drastic]].

## Interruptions
> For a recap of the events as they occurred in game, please refer to [[⎊ Hazel's Arrival]].

Following a chariot race, [[Tyranno Re Ursus]]'s speech inside [[Einon Stadium]] was suddenly overshadowed by the *[[Charybda]]*, a colossal Nortian flagship, setting off alarms at the [[Astral Lighthouse]]. *Captain-[[Buster]]* [[Hazel Sobol]] was launched down and announced to the captive audience that their [[Lazuli Dino|prince]] is [[Dragonic Curse|cursed]] and is an accident waiting to happen: that she shall take him for herself and have the empire siege Drastic. Ten of the thirteen [[Nortian Conspiracy|conspirators]] were in attendance, not including the two leaders of [[Heartknock|Heartknock]] and the top controller.

When [[Ildy]] tried to stop her, declaring that he was protecting the prince from this fate, he was killed by a [[psychobullet]] fired from the deck of the *Charybda*.

Assaulted by a [[moonbeam]], Linnaeus began transforming into a [[dragonic whillo]], in an event where the red light of his energy could be seen from everywhere in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], extending out into the sky. Queen [[Velocis Dino|Velocis]], attempting to rescue him, was punted through the wall of the arena as the attack begins. 

## Survival

[[Star of the North]], the prince's confidant and horrified friend, took up [[Dinofang]] and repelled Hazel with [[S4|the party]]'s aid, but much transpires. 
* [[Shohei Integra|Shohei]]'s still-fragile soul is colossally damaged from the shock of Ildy's death; his guardian [[Serena Nortia|Serena]] possesses his body fully to protect him as he heals. 
* [[Elain Valaransia]] is slain by friendly fire, causing her [[Phoenix Seed]] to grow and ensnare her. ^50937b
* The [[Oldwall Pub]] is destroyed; [[Chadley Korol|Chadley]]'s crew manages to survive, but [[Lurana Moonswallow]] is trapped inside the [[Chahi Decade Reserve]]. 
* The party steals the [[Red Diamond]] airship from the port to get away. 
* The ship [[Ivan's Tiger]], which [[Ikabod Caruso]] was staying on, is raided by [[Trobairitz]] (in order to rescue Certain) before it is destroyed by an onslaught, causing each of the [[Visitant|visitants]] (except for [[Locket]] and [[Pendant]]) to suddenly and rapidly teleport away as a subconscious instinct.  ^f42ea7
* The attacking force linger throughout the day before vanishing, the prince in tow.

## Elsewhere

Earlier the same day, [[Volk Vendleberg]] completed an investigation of [[Feather-Moss Farm|a farmstead]] south of the [[Glass Mountains]], executing a person for traitorous curse-related conduct. The [[Beastkin|shifter]] witnesses the Spark on the way back to [[Waxtown]], receiving a distress call from the [[Trickster's Children]].

At the same time, [[Kessah]] was caught in the middle of an escape attempt by a number of convicts in [[Pendulum]]. As she traveled back to [[Barbiche]], she witnessed the Red Spark. That evening, she left with [[Sekkan-shin]] towards the Glass Mountains.
