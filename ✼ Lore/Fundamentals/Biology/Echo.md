An **echo**, "**shade**", or "**shadow**", is a general arcane term for memory or remains, specifically of a [[Soul|soul]] or aspect of the world, bound into a fixed shape only by agglomerated [[chaos]] itself. Echoes are tied to physical shadows, as well as concepts of resonance. 

Specifically in magical study, echoes are called **[[Psionics|psychic]] data**, as they contain lingering intentions. When used to describe entities, it usually refers to those (including [[Divinity|gods]]) which specifically dwell in or prefer the [[Elseworld|alternate worldline]].
# Properties

When a [[Creature|creature]] [[Death|dies]], all the things that creature knows leave the body in thousands of echoes. All souls in the world are traceable to echoes as their origins. For a living soul, an echo is the "you" remembered by others, while your soul is the "you" they interact with. 

The energy which makes up echoes acts as the universal common ancestor of souls in [[The Heavens]]. By definition, it is a a feral [alter](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alter#English) of [[Chaos]]. Echoes are commonly associated with archaeoarcanology^[That is, the study of the origins of [[Magic]]].

# History
Following the close of the [[Old world|last world]], some creatures from that world remained in these idle, powerless forms. Without body to give them voice, and without soul to give them the ability to [[Wish]], they remained static and unchanged. As the [[Anti|Ignition Point]] rebuilt the world, these interjects, awoken by the [[Golden Voice]], were accepted as necessities, and provided the world with the seeds eventually sown by [[Athemat]] to reinstate the concept of souls and mind to the world.

Echoes flourished when psychospace was created, as it gave them a home to operate within. Although no memory of the old world remained, they were (in a sense) physical memories, and so knew to draw themselves towards larger energies. In the origins of this world, that led to the hoarding of [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]] to preserve their existences. Landmasses which possessed lots of elemental chaos, like [[Bullion]], were ripe for plundering. 

Eventually, strong echoes, now approximate to souls, were able to fathom the [[Divine Equation]] and begin to re-emerge as corporeal beings, the most sapient of which became the [[First Magicians]], as recreated humanity. Other echoes remained in their state to continue collating chaos, eventually becoming [[Elemental creatures]].
