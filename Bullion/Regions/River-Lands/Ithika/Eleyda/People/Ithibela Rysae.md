**Ithibela Suimari Rysae**, known popularly as “**Mari**”, is heiress-apparent to the station of the [[Luminaria]], at the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]]. A [[Tiefling|tief]]-[[Elf|elf]], she is defiantly trans-feminine, a cultural act of rebellion against the changing expectations of River-Lands elves.

In her immediate family, Ithibela has two brothers and two sisters, but is eldest and smartest of each of them. Her father was Eleydan aristocrat [[Raine Selbrede]], and her mother was Luminaria [[Ithana Rysae|Ithana Rysae]]. Her child name was Rico, and her adult name was Aribell.

# History
Rico was born some time in [[1169 PT]].

As a child, Rico was kidnapped by the [[Witch-King]].

Her transition, officially announced on her 111th birthday in [[1281 PT]], was a major political scandal, accepted by elves and some humans while violently opposed by old money in Bullion who desired gender relations to remain static. 

She was later humiliated on her 112th birthday in [[1282 PT]], using a tool created by an apparent ecoterrorist known as [[The Best]].
