![[⎋ Roleplay]]
The **Dragonic War** was an important war between the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] and the forces of [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] as controlled by the [[Nortian Conspiracy]]. It took place from the very end of [[1250 PT]] on to the early months of [[1251 PT]]. It precipitated, and was motivated by, the threat of [[Zero Day]].

Meta-wise, it constituted most of the events of *[[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]]*.

# Prelude
The Conspiracy had been operating since several months prior. They had already prepared for war, though were waiting for a go-ahead.

In 1250 PT, [[Lazuli Dino]] turned to [[Ikabod Caruso]] to assist in curing his [[Dragonic Curse]]. During this process, naturally, Ikabod came to know about the [[curse]] and its properties. When [[Trobairitz]] fleed his care, he hired a new assistant, [[Judia Naz]], who leaked the information about the curse to the Conspiracy.

The curse provided a pretense to capture the prince (as was the Conspiracy's master's wishes), leading to the events of the Summit of Sacred.

## Initial Skirmishes
The unexpectedness of the [[Runic engine|runic engines]] possessed by the Empire, as well as their own ally attacking them, significantly altered the perception of Nortia in the eyes of the Kingdom.
