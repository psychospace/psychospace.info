The **Kingdom of Sacred**, also known as the **Dino Royal Lands**, are the authority controlling the twinned [[Remnant|remnants]] of [[High Sacred]] and [[Low Sacred]]. It is ruled by a [[House Dino|monarchy]] and a council of dukes, and its capital city is in [[Drastic]]. Its symbol is a [[Star|five-pointed star]].

The demonym for Sacred is "*Sacreder*" or "*Sacredite*".****

# Traditions
The military of the Kingdom is known as the [[Sacred Dragoon Force]]. Its policing force is the [[Victory Starscouts]].

The Kingdom of Sacred names [[Year (unit)|years]] of great import, and years in-between as having been "Year Beyond" initially or "Year Two After X" or so on, using named years as a baseline for unnamed years. If it's easier, some people (mostly in Low Sacred) utilize terms such as "Year Before" or "Year Two Prior To X" when constructing frames of reference to long lengths of time between striking events.

The twin remnants of Sacred are reflected in its people, deliciously diverse yet decidedly unsure of one another. Since the two are bridged by only the [[Eight Bridges of Sacred]], three of which are on the flipside, not many people from High Sacred ever see what Low Sacred has to offer.


# History
The previous inhabitants of this region were the [[Carapa Republic]].

During a many-year conflict which began in [[742 PT]], [[Plesio Falknjir]], a bandit king from Low Sacred, overthrew the Republic. His family and those who have kept the crown's lineage intact have since become known as [[House Dino]], and act as the present day rulers of the land. When Plesio was about to overthrow the [[Drastic|Holy Port of Ace]], it was said he saw a star fall from the sky in the lands now known as the [[Starcrater Fields]].

According to legend (and the [[Aboleth|aboleth]] [[Golorr]]), with his dying breath, the last lord of the Carapaeans [[Curse|cursed]] the crown with the [[Dragonic Curse]] they had locked away, which repeatedly ravaged the royal line.

After the Kingdom's founding, the new government made peace with the Low Sacreders and gave them a centralized government and a say in how the kingdom was run, vastly different from their predecessors in the [[Unitor|Unitors]]. This sort of “invade and then apologize later” mentality hasn’t faded for the entire span of the Kingdom, and even with representation many people in Low Sacred are concerned that Highs don’t care too much for them or simply treat them as lesser.

## Modern Era

The [[War of the Masters]] was the first major conflict which the Kingdom fought, and its slow speed and questionable motives lead to widespread common sentiment against the monarchy. In response to the animosity, the Kingdom's efforts at-home crystallized as the [[Ban of Ignoble Conduct]], which effectively halted efforts for individual violent action (or "adventuring") and reaffirmed the Kingdom's stance on self-governance. 

However, eventually, a rebellious small group known as [[Critical Hit]] unlocked the [[Vault of Foretelling]], an act which led to the Ban's repeal, the war's end, and, inadvertently, to an entire [[Age of Adventurers]]. With this, Critical Hit rose to stardom, and became autonomous agents of the Kingdom. However, after the [[Catharia Incident]], many of them broke away from one another.

The next major turn for the Kingdom would come when they were attacked by their would-be ally [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] in the [[Red Spark]], an event which led to an accelerated conflict known as the [[Dragonic War]]. Prior to this, a strange [[ghost storm]] had damaged and disturbed the countryside, along with a cult known as the [[Heartknock]]. With the dragonic curse revealed to all to be a massive liability, and the young [[Lazuli Dino]] stolen away, the conflict saw many betrayals, twists, and turns, all while a group known as the [[S4]] worked under the order of the silver drake [[Sekkan-shin]] to "reunite" the disparate members of Critical Hit, in secret to reunite the stone of Golorr.

With Golorr reunited, the cure to the curse was laid bare and after breaching the "Carapaean Contingency", a supposed plan orchestrated to preserve and restore the dynasty of Carapa, the cure was in-hand, following the sacrifice of the wraithsword [[Wings of the End]]. The S4 then left aboard *[[Wings of Dawn]]* to Nortia, and on [[Zero Day]], the prince was rescued and the war was ended, resulting in ultimately the [[sky-scrape]] etched into the atmosphere, and, supposedly, the advent of [[new magic]].

## Post-Zero Day

The dragonic curse no longer a factor, Sacred and Nortia (after excising the [[Nortian Conspiracy]] which had taken it) founded the [[Order of Hope]], and began efforts to pick up the pieces. Since the Dragonic War and since the S4's own rise to popularity, sovereign Lazuli has helped to lead the country in a healthy direction, and has sired three children with their consort [[Star of the North]]. 

The future remains ever-unexpectable, and the Kingdom continues to struggle to both deal with and accommodate new-magic.
