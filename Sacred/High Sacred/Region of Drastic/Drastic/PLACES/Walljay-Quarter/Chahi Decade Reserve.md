The **Chahi Decade Reserve** was a priceless [[Antique|artifact]] wine in the possession of [[Lurana Moonswallow]], kept in the cellar of the [[Oldwall Pub]]. It defied [[Gravity]].

It was once used by an old master of the [[Constellar School]] named [[Erik Chahi]] to contain many monsters for study, connected to a strange and ethereally time-stretched prison, overseen by a [[beholder]] named **Howboi**.

The [[Plane#demiplane|demiplane]] experiences [[time]] at 1/30th the speed of the outside world, meaning one day outside is a month inside. This time dilation does not occur with regard to rest: in other words you can become exhausted very easily inside the plane, as sleep will need to take a minimum of ten days to count.

Following the [[Red Spark]], Lurana was trapped inside the Reserve for six days, which to her felt as though she'd been trapped for six months.
