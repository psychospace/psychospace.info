**Chiave Neeman** is a [[Elf#Half-elf|half-elf]] druid. He started the journey with his [[Serratura Neeman|twin sister]] as part of the [[S4|Royal Escort Group]].

He wears a friendship bracelet given to him by [[Eldral Levin]], and promised to return to them with it on. He studied with the kenku in [[The Whiskerwood]].

Later, he was kidnapped by the [[Nortian Conspiracy]] and taken to [[Dom Otdykha]] to be inducted into their ranks, but was rescued by the S4 before that could happen.

Chiave is 20.
