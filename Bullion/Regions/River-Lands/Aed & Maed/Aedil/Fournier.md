Home of the famous [[Del Rio Ranch]] and admittedly very little else, **Fournier**^[four-nee-yay] is a trading town along the [[Rio Insólito]], in the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]] of [[Bullion]]. It is called the **Town of Humble Steps** by the [[Kuroki Almanac]].

# History
The site was originally settled by an [[Archipel|Archipelian]] elvish conquistador who offered the settlement their name, along the bed of [[Lake Cor]] where it intersects with the Rio Insólito.

The modern town of Fournier had to be rebuilt following the [[Great Hurricane]], which caused the displacement of most of its residents save for the del Rio family. The town mostly escaped the effects of the [[taphrine]] epidemic in [[1280 PT]]. 

A [[train]] stop for the [[Lainese Heavy Industries|LHI North]] line was constructed here sometime recently.

# Description
Fournier is, by most accounts, like any other town in the whole of the [[Aed & Maed]], making most of its income from agricultural activities and tourism. The [[Age of Adventurers]] has offered new opportunities, and the town has since become a popular place for adventurers to seek employment, escaping the often competitively-priced work that arises in Anacoreta.

Around two dozen families live here, though the opening of a local [[Hotel Pincherle]] has brought investment into developing the area once used as farmland, but was left devastated by the hurricane.

It is known that Fournier has a healthy tourist population in the autumn and winter, in part because it offers a good stopover to [[Anacoreta]], and also because it is a famously good viewing position for the annual [[Meteor Dance]] over the [[Aedil Plains]], as well as the night sky in general, which is almost always clearly visible from the city. 

The summer climate is often muggy. The nearby touristy [[On'Cor Caves]] offer the everyman a chance to see the often over-looked fascinating plant life and ecology of the flipside of [[Tarnation]].
