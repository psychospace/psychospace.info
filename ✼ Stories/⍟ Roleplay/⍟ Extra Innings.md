**Extra Innings** is a series taking place in [[The Heavens]] in [[1249 PT]]. It was run in *Pathfinder 2e*, starting on July 14th, 2023, by January November.

The events of XI concern several people revived in the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]], and their quest to uncover more about the being that brought them back. In the course of this, they explore each of the [[Base (XI)|Bases]], and are confronted by the story of a strange girl named [[Ciro Enfys|Ciro]].

>**"Say, friend. I've had my fun. This time, you walk free."**
>
>The words, sourceless, but loud. The sensation, inexplicable, but warm. The pain, immense, but dulled. No... it wasn't that. You didn't feel any pain at all. 
>
>Near to the brink of oblivion, with the wind at your back, you pushed forward to recover and tell the tale.
>
>The [[Roced|Blood Arbiter]] came to collect, and you've skipped the bill, like many a hero before you. Ready or not, you're a for-sure living legend, now. This was thanks in part to the influence of (though the memory's distant now) [[The Pitcher|a cryptic stranger]]: a pallid skinny-looking thing, no taller than a kid, carrying a toy on a string. Then, you came to, sure as the bucket you'd kicked.
>
>Who was this figure? And why are you alive because of them? Both excellent questions, ones you're not prepared to answer in the slightest. If you were anybody but the kind of person you are, nobody'd believe what you'd seen, even in a world as magical and mysterious as this one. The gods don't play dice. Whether you're from the cities or the vast wilds yonder, here you stand, second-chance in hand.

>It's 1249 PT, and things are getting stranger for you by the day. The *[[Daily Grind]],* a weird-world newspaper tabloid circulating in the [[Upper Kernwelt]], heard tell of your tale through the grapevine. And to your worst realization, in fact, they'd heard the same thing from more than one person — you're no isolated miracle. A young *huasa*, a reporter for the *Grind* named Julia, is offering a tantalizing 3,000 [[Gold piece|gold]] to the folks who can bring her physical evidence of the stranger. For that price, who would refuse a good ol' fashioned god-hunt?

>What will you do with this unusual chance to change your fortune? What debts, earthly or otherwise, will you bet against the odds?

>How will your trail be blazed?

> ## WORLD INTRO
>
>This game takes place in summer, 1249 Pinwheel Tempo (PT), about a year and a half before the events of another campaign, *[[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]]*. A while before Prince Linnaeus is kidnapped and the future of the world becomes uncertain, some futures begin to click into place in the far-off realms of the remnant of [[Bullion]], where forces untold have long held sway... where its most significant ancient society once climbed to the stars.

>Overseen by a intergovernmental concord known as [[The Shibboleth]] (also called "the shib"), this diverse and dusty plane is home to the tradition of the “*[[Wildwalker]]*”, the *gaucho*, the *huaso* — a mercenary lifestyle of forgin' into untamed territory, horsebound, and turning profit helpin' folk what needs helpin', and killin' what needs killin'. If you're in your prime and got no place better to go, chances are you're a wildwalker.

> ## WHAT IN TARNATION?!
This is a short series played in Pathfinder 2e. It will run approximately five times through the course of the summer, and (hopefully) will be run in person.

Your characters... have been brought back to life by a mysterious force, a pale... kid-looking thing, and are being invited to track this story down to the source. Aside from that, the world is more or less your oyster. 
>
>If you choose to be from Bullion (as what makes sense), are several places your characters may be from, though as a general guide for character creation, here are some regions:
>
>- **The Northern Limit**: A mountainous tundra in the northeast untouched by most industrialization, where the native beastkin populations of [[Naciente]], inside the legendary First Forest, are promised safety from aggression. the mountains almost resemble rising walls cradling them
>- **[[Aed & Maed]]** (pronounced like "aid and maid"): To the north-middle of the landmass, where the River-Lands luminaries seat their power in the highlands, flanked on all sides by grassy plains where farms and small townships reign
>- **Reyezuela**: A volcanic region marked with ruins and vast chilly forests, once blown apart by a meteor impact and torn asunder by a civil war, now home to the intellectual center of the remnant in the Manteian Institutional Conservatory (aka the "Fifth Institute")
>- **The Cracked Sea**: These islands (and the nearest place on the main landmass), broken off in the wake of the apocalyptic impact event, harbor fascinating cultures and even more fascinating rewards for the intrepid explorer
>- **[[Kernwelt]]**: The lower center of the landmass is home to dwarvish and other tunneler folk inside dusty mesas and clay villages, such as the harengon of the Siella Valley. Underground here are vast networks of complex ruins with a vast history, which has led to a culture of survivalists and explorers who brave them. Push further south and you'll reach Sirrhad, a conglomeration of cities united by commerce and freedom of expression.
