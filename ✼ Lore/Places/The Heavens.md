The **Heavens** is a term which is widely used to describe [[the Planet]] (usually her [[creature|inhabitants]]) and her [[Lex|two]] [[Ordo|moons]], creations of the [[Divinity|gods]]. More broadly, the Heavens describes the physical [[Plane#Realm|realms]] of influence of [[Psychospace|psychospace]] and other spheres, especially the [[The Planet#Planar stack|planar stack]].

Within the Heavens, [[magic]] and [[Logic]] are known to function as described. Most within the world can only dream what is beyond the Heavens, somewhere [[Out There|Out There]].

Under modern definitions of the Heavens, they are known to comprise at least the planets of the [[Antic Sea]]. It is unknown if the Heavens may comprise any other planets beyond the Antic Sea, though some [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] texts suggest so.
