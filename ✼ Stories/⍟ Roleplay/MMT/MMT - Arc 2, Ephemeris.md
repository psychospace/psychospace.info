***Ephemeris*** was the second arc of [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]].

In *Ephemeris*, a [[Lethal|mysterious individual]] who exactly resembles the [[Lazuli Dino|kidnapped prince]] draws the party into a web of mysteries. As forces sprawl behind the invasion and the curse itself, the queen calls for [[Project Ephemeris|national cooperation]], and the [[S4]] is truly born as a collective. When [[Volk Vendleberg]] is kidnapped and assumed killed, and [[Chiave Neeman|Chiave]] stolen as part of some plan, the party embark to rescue their friends from [[Dom Otdykha]]. ^321688

Meta-wise, this arc consisted of sessions 19 through 36, lasting from September 2020 to August 2021.

# Events
## [[Augenschein]], [[1250 PT]]
### Fourth of Augenschein
In Waxtown, the party meets [[Volk Vendleberg]], a royal executioner, who is hunting down someone who abandoned his post immediately prior to the Summit, as though he knew it was coming. The party finds him in [[Waxcutter Library]], and chases him down into an underground bridge-base where the local [[Spider's Web]] administrator, none other than Arthur's brother [[Igor Ingolstadt|Igor]], is waiting for them. 

The party attacks and kills Igor, though his body is stolen through a portal. The party also recruits someone who looks exactly like the prince, [[Lethal]], who was just recruited into the Web and wants to know why he can't remember anything. The party rests up at Volk's home, [[Castle Xilan]]. Elsewhere, Kessah and Sekkan survey the damages done to Drastic before departing for Waxtown.

### Fifth of Augenschein
That evening, the group attends a formal party for the New Year's held by fearful nobility at [[Sharkbite Bluff]]. There, they meet up with [[The Runts]] again, and also meet Kessah and her silver [[Dragon]] patron [[Sekkan-shin]]. Sekkan-shin tasks the party with, to stop yet another war, “reuniting” the legendary members of [[Critical Hit]]. Serratura takes a strange cat home to Castle Xilan.
## [[1251 PT#Ersta (1)|Ersta, 1251 PT]]
### 1-1-1251
* Queen [[Velocis Dino]] [[⎉ Declaration of Project Ephemeris|announces]] [[Project Ephemeris]]. The strange cat that [[Serratura Neeman|Serratura]] took to [[Castle Xilan]] is revealed to be [[Concordia]], a servant of [[Sharkbite Bluff]] who has been saved. Under the captaining of [[Star of the North]], the [[Red Diamond]] takes wing first to [[Somnia]], then to the [[Royal Bladeworks]][^22]. 
* On the way to Somnia, the party are attacked by [[Heartknock]] again[^23]. 
### 1-2-1251
Upon arrival at the Bladeworks late in the day, a moot is held by the higher ups of the [[Sacred Dragoon Force]] on a theoretical strategy to push the war forward in their favor[^24]. 
* Following the quest given to them by [[Sekkan-shin]], the party receive audience with [[Ridd of Chained-Earth]] (after proving themselves in [[Puretza]]'s [[The Sheer|Sheer]] arena[^25]) who informs them that Sekkan may not have been entirely forthcoming: when he said "Reunite [[Critical Hit]]", he was referencing the [[Golorr|Stone of Golorr]][^26]. 
* Star is convinced to stay behind and apprentice with Ridd, in order to understand the tie that [[Dinofang]] has to the prince: without her, the party recruits some of the many people outside the Bladeworks as a new crew for the Diamond[^27]. The party also takes their new name as the [[S4]].

The Red Diamond takes wing and sets out to return to [[Drastic]]. In the night, the party is attacked by the [[House of Horrors]], who curse [[Arthur Graywell|Arthur]] with lycanthropy. The proximity to [[Void energy|negative energy]] causes [[Lethal]] to react with an unusual dream[^28].

### 1-3-1251 
* In midday, the S4 touches down in Drastic once again. In front of the [[S4t|Beatific Keep]], a tree has been erected from the blossoming of the [[Phoenix Seed]]. [[Eldral Levin]] revives the figure trapped inside it, revealed to be [[Elain Valaransia]], an abandoned member of the Conspiracy[^29]. Elain propositions to take someone behind enemy lines, taking [[Volk Vendleberg]] with her as she teleports.  The [[Trickster's Children]] steal their ways into the Beatific Keep to obtain Elain and surreptitiously retrieve the [[Wand of Mythos]] from Arthur, who'd been holding onto it since [[Ildy]]'s death. When Elain vanishes, the children become sloppy and are discovered. In response, Arthur reacts with righteous anger and calls forth a T-rex to stop them, an act which gets him sent to the [[Union Keep]] by [[Hieron Dredge]][^30].
* At [[Dom Otdykha]], Volk and Elain arrive. However, Elain is already about to be replaced, as she was Ranked XIIIth and is no longer necessary. They are led by [[Hazel Sobol]] to the helm of the ship, where [[Wren Doggabone|the Wrench]] has Elain dragged off and Volk tortured by the [[Nine Lives Stealer]], a process which magically kills him. [[Serena Nortia]], close by, manages to use [[Monism]] to rescue Volk's soul, though at the cost of her leg.[^30a] Noting the oddity with Volk's soul lingering behind, his body is thrown in a jail cell for study.

### 1-4-1251
The party is forced to spend a day without two members, and Arthur learns in captivity that Volk was killed.[^31]

### 1-5-1251
Arthur is freed thanks to Hieron pulling strings. The party, seeking more pieces of the Stone, travels to the [[Oldwall Pub]], now ruined, where [[Chadley Korol]] is waiting with his retainers [[Nihiru Shizuka]], [[Lars Lohrsword]], and [[Ben Kaber]]. With the mighty captain's help, [[Lurana Moonswallow]] is freed from the [[Chahi Decade Reserve]][^32]. That night, Serratura dreams of [[Chiave Neeman|Chiave]]'s kidnapping from [[The Whiskerwood]], and the party receives even more reason to travel to Dom Otdykha[^33].

### 1-6-1251
The party learns that the Conspiracy plan to attack [[Port Fester]] in 5 days. With this in mind, the party begin their plan to subvert the attack and rescue their party members in one fell swoop. With Sekkan-shin in tow[^34], the S4 set out towards [[Barbiche]][^35].

%%???%%

### 1-10-1251 
Late into the night, the S4 siege Dom Otdykha, rescuing Volk and Chiave and severely damaging the installation.[^36]
