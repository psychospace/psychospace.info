**Buttons** and **Snooze Melior** are conjoined [[Human]] sisters born by a [[Curse]] on their [[Soul]]. They share a body, which has two heads, and share some manner of control over each other's "half". 

However, since they were born "one-bodied" (and not, perhaps, traditionally conjoined), Snooze's brain receives little blood, causing her to be narcoleptic or at least mostly exhausted at all times. Her sister Buttons acts as the leader between them, and she receives far too much blood, turning her eyes bloodshot. Buttons seeks a way to heal their body to restore them both to equal health in their body.

They are currently shipmates aboard the *[[Wings of Dawn]]*. The sisters practice and study [[Wild Magic]] [[sorcery]] to defend themselves.

They don't speak much of their past. Of course, they have on occasion, but theirs is a story of perplexing circumstance. They recall imbibing some grave liquid substance, undertaking great faith in some mysterious entity named [[Lavastus|the Lost Hunter]], and inflicting harm upon their own body in the pursuit of potions and sight beyond worlds. It's a past long forgot to them, seemingly for good reason, but it seems at the same time to not even be theirs: both of the girls claim they were "alone" at the time, yet describe similar things.

Their true past is that of [[Chance Seria]], a transgender blood hunter.

They first encounter the adventurers outside [[Gateway]], scaring off goblins, who believe them to be a young ettin.
