Officially dubbed [[Project KC]], the **Nortian Conspiracy** was a treasonous government group that subverted the [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] empire in mid-[[1250 PT]], leading to the [[Dragonic War]]. Overseen by [[Illarion Parasom]]  and [[Scarla Nitrum]], it was primarily led by thirteen individuals, following a mythological fascination with [[Dizforia]]. The group kidnapped [[Linnaeus Dino|Prince Linnaeus Dino]].

The ultimate goal of the Conspiracy was to obtain proof of [[Occultation]], an immense power which [[Arizhmiya]] had created, which could halt the onset of an impending [[collapse state]].

# History

## Origins
In [[1245 PT]], [[Octavia Parasom|Octavia]] and [[Amanita Parasom]] discovered [[the Fortress]] and the [[Collapse state|collapsed]] [[elseworld]] were thinly but persistently connected to the real world, discovered through a [[ritual]] held within a [[Visage of the Fortress#Anomaly|novel]], with those bonds appearing to strengthen day by day. With the threat of a world-ending singularity proven, their father Illarion moved that the top-secret [[Project KC]] be revised to further research into [[the Fortress]], at any cost. 

These attempts were blocked by Bianca under the pretense that [[the Sheer]] was far safer (due to her family's [[Logic|logical]] ties to it, and [[Uforia]]'s semi-divine status). The access hole Amanita discovered eventually grew and caused the [[Farborough Manor]] to temporarily and occasionally vanish, seemingly proving Bianca's notions of the Gutter.

At this juncture, Illarion began to see and hear [[Arizhmiya]] as a benevolent figure, an [[angel]] who said that the gods would not save them, telling him the only person who could stop the end of the world was himself. As Arizhmiya would later admit through *[[contact other plane]]*, all the god of the past did was tell Illarion what he already believed, feeding his desperate ambition. 


## Preparations
Originally beginning full-assembly in [[1249 PT]], bringing many of the most powerful political figures and combatants that Nortia had at her disposal, Illarion and Scarla convinced them of his goal to stop an immense power from seizing reality. 

The political figures were to fund the secret research being conducted to prepare the empire, especially the laboratories at the [[Nail of Nortia]], for the process of making use of the occult artifact. The combatants and casters were to stand-by and prepare their voyage east towards the lands of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], where Arizhmiya claimed "a grim destiny thrives, and you shall bring it to justice."

Under [[Wren Doggabone]], the [[Navy of Cacophony]], the [[Army of Euphony]] and particularly [[Hazel Sobol]] were under their command. Illarion already commanded the [[Prime Doppelguard]].

The criminal cult known as [[Heartknock]] was created to further facilitate experimentation on Sacred to find the source of occultation or further rebuff its power. Many criminals and civilian engineers were reclaimed for the Heartknock to work on esoterica, such as their [[Shiny Mask|shiny masks]], or their experimentation.

Despite being unaware of all of this, Bianca became increasingly convinced that her [[Lord of Law]] was to betray her, and though she allowed the preparations for emergencies, she began to hide away and protect herself. Even she, however, was incapable of perceiving the lengths to which the entity that was his wife would go.

By cooperating with Arizhmiya, who Illarion assumed was an [[angel]], in the month of [[1250 PT#Alssad (6)|Alssad in 1250 PT]], Bianca's [[soul]] was placed into apparent stasis and Scarla took her body over. Illarion and "the Empress" thusly quietly assumed control of the government.[[Serena Nortia]] and [[Iosif Nortia|all]] [[Lidiya Nortia|her]] [[Leonid Nortia|kin]] seemingly lost contact with their mother, which was explained as something "testing [their] connections". Serena also ended up discovering the redirected funds, which Illarion was able to conceal.

## Discovery

Near the end of the year, the Conspiracy learned of the [[dragonic curse]]'s continued existence through [[Judia Naz]]. Illarion apparently realized that this was the proof of occultation and the "grim destiny", and used this as an excuse to seize control over the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], a goal which would help them "cleanse" it of all curses.

This would be revealed when [[Linnaeus Dino|Linnaeus]] was most vulnerable and the populace could receive such a message, during the Summit of Sacred. Illarion had predicted from an interpretation of the [[Apocrypha of Winds]] that Serena would be present at the onset of the war, and thus when she evacuated Yofora in fear of her life, without believing that her mother was taken over, all was seeming to align.

On the Third of Augenschien, the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]] took place. Due to the secrecy with which the Nortian Empire already operated, Sacred had no preparations or anticipation for the attack, and was caught well off-guard by their once-ally. [[Ildy]] was slain, Linnaeus's curse was set in motion and revealed, and the prince himself was kidnapped, taken to the [[Nail of Nortia]] where he would be kept protected in the Masterwork Laboratory.

Through the massive amounts of control at the Conspiracy's fingertips, a three-month conflict followed known as the [[Dragonic War]]. During this, bedlam raged across Sacred, while a [[S4|particular group]] hunted down a cure to the curse, regularly beating back the Conspiracy's attempts to steal their progress.
