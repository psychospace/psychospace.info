**Volk [[House Vendleberg|Vendleberg]]** is a 23-year old wildhunt [[Beastkin|shifter]], meaning he has an accord with an animal spirit, in this case the wolf, whose blood and soul intermingles with his, passed down by a lycanthrope in his lineage. At a distance, he could be mistaken for a human, but up close would reveal a lot more teeth and hair than the average man. He's of average height (5'6") and weight (175 lbs.) but has defined muscles.

Volk is a monk of mercy.

Volk is a bastard son of [[House Burgitsk]], a remarkable feat considering how open the Burgitsk family are at expansion.

His body has a lot more hair than most, its thickness bordering on fur in some areas. He's got wolf ears that pop up through slits in his hood. Clothes are fairly similar to the photo but made of much finer cloth and silk. Clothes are black but not not like the edgy kind of black. By his side in a sheath, he holds a ceremonial-looking sword he uses for executions, and has unkempt nails and long hair with strong amounts of facial hair with sideburns and hair which creeps down to his nose, the pattern almost framing his face as a wolf.
