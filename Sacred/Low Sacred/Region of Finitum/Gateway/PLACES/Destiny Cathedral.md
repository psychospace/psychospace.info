**Destiny Cathedral** is a landmark of the city of [[Gateway]]. This iconic floating cathedral in [[Gateway]] was built by a famous cleric in the time of the [[Carapa Republic]].

The main building usually only takes visitors of importance. Its congregation generally worship [[Athemat]] and all of its kin. Visiting the building involves being pulled into it on a column of light in the middle of a courtyard below, guarded by warriors in full plate that completely conceals them. The building itself is extremely opulent, and in addition, glows brightly due to the magical effects of its existence, making it a beacon in the night.

The Cathedral is overseen by [[Werwin Krara]], a local lord.
