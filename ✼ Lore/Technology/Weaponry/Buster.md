A **buster** is a term widely-used for a hunter of monsters or abnormal foes, distinguished from a hunter of [game](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_(hunting)), especially in military contexts as a commendation of rank or role (i.e. "lieutenant-buster"). Although originating as a religious term for a hunter of [[undead]] specifically, it has seen far more use in the general sense, ironically often by the [[dullahan]] corps of [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]].

During the [[Dragonic War]] and following [[Zero Day]], the term was synonymous initially with the apparent-leader of the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], captain-buster [[Hazel Sobol]] (as simply "Buster Hazel"). 

# Etymology
The term stems from ancient terminology which is believed to refer to [[Exorcism|exorcists]], as destroyers of terminal influence. "Buster", as a result of the connotation of monster-hunters being brave, tough, destructive, and sometimes foolish, has also come to mean someone with a lot of bravado, vice, and/or ego (as in, "he's something of a buster").
