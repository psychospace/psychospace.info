The Whiskerwood is a small town in [[the Beastlands]], where the Neemans grew up. This place worships the [[Cat Lord]], and catnip grows wild here.

Home to [[Clan Whiskerwood|three]] [[Underfoot Family|families]], including the [[Serratura Neeman|Neemans]], it has a very tightknit community, unified by its love of nature and deeprooted fear of the outside world. In recent years the lifetimes of the people there have been spent training each other for the dangers of [[Low Sacred]].
