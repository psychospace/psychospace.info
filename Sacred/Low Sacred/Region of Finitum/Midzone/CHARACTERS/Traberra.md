**Traberra** is the [[Eidolon]] defender of [[Midzone]] who embodies sanctuary.

Being that Midzone is a tightknit valley community, Traberra offers her keen eyes and strong wings to those who surrender their weapons. A pacifist by nature, she would rather enjoy her life than be troubled with the outside world. Her symbol is a flagon.

She is very good at making pancakes, and her recipe book might just be her most prized possession.

Like most eidolons, she has equine and draconic features.
