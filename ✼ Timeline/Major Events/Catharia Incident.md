In [[1230 PT]], while investigating a dangerous island near the volcanic remnant of [[Catharia]], [[Jakoby Cutler]], friend to [[Nery Ravenna]], was killed in a catastrophic **incident**, due to a miscalculation and error made by [[Ikabod Caruso]] when calculating the spin of the island. The [[airship]] Cutler was on failed to land at an accommodating speed for the friction and was shredded to pieces.

As such, the mission was hastily aborted and Ikabod, for his failure, was discarded as an ally by [[Critical Hit]]. Afterwards, Ikabod sank into depression.
