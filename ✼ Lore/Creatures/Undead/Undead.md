An **undead** is a [[body|body]] or [[soul|soul]] which continues moving and existing in open mockery of the [[creature]]'s [[Death|death]], a state of existence anathematic to [[Divinity|divine]] principles like the [[reincarnation|cycle of souls]]. 

These beings invert the notion of life, emblematic by their general affinity for [[void energy]] and disavowal for all things [[Vitality energy|vitality]]. Undeath often emerges wherever [[Confluence|confluxes]] between the two are found (for example, the [[Base (XI)|Bases]]), where the balance of life and death is upset, to the point where "undead [[Curse|curses]]" are a common story trope across the many [[Remnant|remnants]].

Broadly considered [[Monster|monstrous]], undead span a vast array of complexity and power levels, from the simplistic but powerful skeletons to the defiantly powerful liches. 

# Properties
The state of undeath causes the remains to persist motivity by slowly sapping energy from its surroundings, typically the [[Off-wave|off-waves]] of whatever or what energy created it. This can create [[Light (property)#Darkness|Darkness]], and so can distort [[psychospace]] in general.^[As in the quoted passage at the beginning of this article.] Because of this, and a lack of need to hunt or seek out alternate comforts, undead are rarely seen moving from place to place, especially in the [[Starfall|day]] (where, like [[vampire|vampires]], it is said they cannot stomach the light of [[Cien]]). This is largely what amounts to an undead's self-preservation instinct.

By nature of this tenuous state, though, they also remain hostile to life, as the undead who completely loses itself and brings about death is ever rewarded with a new source of void energy as succor. Similar to other [[figment|figmentalized]] soul forms (such as [[quori]]), it is said that entire crypts besodden by undeath can form "[[telepathy|crypt-minds]]" with one another as a form of hivemind, sharing in this goal to bring about more death for the good of all of them. It is worth noting that undead are rarely observed conflicting with one another, unless one gets in the other's way, or [[Echo|echoes]] of life led to an extremely animus bond with one another. 

A soul which is subject to undeath loses its natural ability to travel to [[Unwri]], unless it is restored by [[resurrection]] magic or manually retrieved by a [[psychopomp]], as a necessary means of its state of [[reincarnation]] being bound or placed in stasis. In other words: once a soul is undead, it is always undead, unless a particular rite is performed. This has both good aspects and bad aspects.

# Origins
Undead are usually the product of [[Necromancy|necromancy]], which is in some cases considered altogether the "study of undead", though this isn't exclusively the case. Necromancers exploit the tenuous remains of any *[[fylgja]]* in the remains of a creature, using these scraps to revive only its motivity and not its true personality (as by a [[resurrection]]) in order to control them as a puppet.

Some undead originate through through potent [[Soul bond|bonds]] to the events and circumstances around their original death, and have been known to possess much further intelligence than is possible through necromantic reanimation, at the cost of some abilities. These undead often shirk the fate which awaited them to settle it on their own terms. For example, a [[ghost]] often remains due to unfinished business or unresolved emotions, a fate which would otherwise lead them to [[Melotte]].
