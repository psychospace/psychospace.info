**Ithuriel Corrata Rysae**, also known as **Ithuriel I**, is a mythological figure, known as the first hero of the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]], credited with bringing the territory back from the brink during [[Bullion]]'s [[Bullion#Fourth Era|Fourth Era]]. 

An [[owlin]] who aided and guided the elves from [[Archipel]], he was the first [[Luminaria]] of the River-Lands. Ithuriel was aided in this task by twin mages [[Aedil Rysae|Aedil]] and [[Maedil Rysae]], the latter of whom was his consort, and by many other varied characters that help form the foundation of many cultural origin myths throughout the region. By [[Amad'Oroa]]'s account, Ithuriel may have been the first new [[saint]] of Bullion since the [[Os'Grun]] Impact.

Since his stories have spread far and wide throughout Bullion, veneration and respect for Ithuriel as a hero have also spread as far. Each luminaria now bears his name in honor and thanks to his legend, with the [[Maedil Regalia]] especially designed to convey the power and symbol of the wise owlin to its wearer.
