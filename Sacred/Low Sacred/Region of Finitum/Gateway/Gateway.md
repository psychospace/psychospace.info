**Gateway** was once a small fort erected in the mountains by a young [[Kingdom of Sacred]], hoping to defeat the orcs that continually filtered through Scarred Sacred. It's now a modern city, flush with history and life.

It's bordered by the [[Lilliputian Battlefield]] to the east and the road to [[Wisfer]] to the west. Its eidolon is [[Klemma]].
