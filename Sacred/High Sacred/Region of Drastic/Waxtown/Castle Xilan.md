The current home of [[House Vendleberg]], **Castle Xilan** is an ancestral castle of blackstone. 

It has traded hands dozens of times ever since it was constructed in the time of the [[Carapa Republic]]. In the time of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], it was reworked and reinforced initially as a prison for scholars who went mad or those who defiled the library's sanctuary. But now it's a family's house, half a training ground and half a gutted fortress. It has exchanged hands about a dozen times in the intervening years since.
