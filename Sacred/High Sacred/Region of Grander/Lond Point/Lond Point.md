**Lond Point** is a village in the [[Duchy of Grander]] in [[High Sacred]]. Just north of [[Rainbow Ridge]], the town was founded as a stop between that town and [[Miraclesfield]], when it became viable to pass through the swamp northward as a result of infrastructural projects completed by [[Victory Starscouts]].

The dirt here grows grass of an exceptionally green color, which has long inspired many artists to live in the area, though only recently was a proper town founded on this spot. With its proximity to the Lond Swamp, it also elicits a great deal of danger with the myriad monsters. This has similarly attracted adventurers to its halls.

This town is relatively new, and came to be a more notable settlement when [[Drachedion Balthazar]] decided to construct his manor, [[Puzzledam]], north of it. Its staff were given housing here and many people flocked to visit the architectural wonder.
