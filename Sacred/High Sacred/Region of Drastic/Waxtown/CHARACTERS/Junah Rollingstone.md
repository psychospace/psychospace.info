![[âŽ‹ Needs Expansion]]

**Junah Rollingstone** is a mountain [[Dwarf]], a philosopher and philanthrope, and vicar of [[Bioh]]. An old member of [[Critical Hit]], he now spends his time as an investor in culture.

# History
A powerful noble already part of a mining operation in [[Miraclesfield]], Junah was punished for sympathy he held towards a slain dark elven worker in his father's employ, [[Precari Nailo]]. Precari was survived by her nonbinary sibling, [[Drayla Nailo|Drayla]], also in [[Bain Rollingstone]]'s employ under the [[Rollingstone Mining Company]]. Junah plotted to thieve a piece of his father's fortune and flee Miraclesfield with Drayla, and the plan went off without a hitch, although Bain did find out.

Without much in the way of places to go, he traveled to [[Waxtown]] and bought Drayla a house there before promising that Bioh would guide her way back to her sister. Still aware that his father's agents were at his heels, he fled south further aboard a tour ship and reached the capitol, [[Drastic]]. While here he joined Critical Hit to distract himself and seek out new ventures of treasures other than through his father, ready to make a new name for the Rollingstone house: one that cared for its workers and fought for justice rather than for profit.

Junah lives in [[Waxtown]] with Drayla and a dwarven woman, [[Aegis Lockstock]], in a polyamorous open relationship. However, he is currently recovering from an entanglement with [[Tarnation]] in the remnant of [[Bullion]], leaving Aegis and Drayla together.
