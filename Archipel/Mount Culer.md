A massive snowy mountain, **Mount Culer** is known for it's "downy snow", which stays extremely cold even through transport.

There lies a settlement of sea elves, also called "frost elves", on the peak of Mount Culer.

Within one cliffside is a three-pronged cave that looks like a claw mark. This is where the tabaxi clan of [[Cule Cliffside]] resides.
