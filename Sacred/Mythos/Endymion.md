**Endymion** was an ancient [[Elf|elven]] hero — in some interpretations, one of the [[First Magicians]] — who was said to court [[Time]] itself. The oldest known attestation comes from the [[Carapa Republic]], though the myth seems to predate them, passed on to explain the discordant rhythm of the twin moons.

In various versions of his myths, Endymion is said to have played a game with the twin dancing moon sisters Lun and Eline, also known later as [[Lex]] and [[Ordo]]. 

It is said that with this game, Endymion gambled for “hours” of time with the moon sisters, which they used in their dance to bargain the moon cycles and the fates of mortals between them. It is said that at the beginning of the [[Age of the Gods]], each sister had 32 “hours” apiece, and thus their dance was perfectly matched, each moon having an even number of cycles every 32 days. But Endymion snatched away 3 hours from Lun, forcing Eline to dance faster to keep up with her sister. 

This caused Eline’s energy to diminish, forcing her moon, the blue one, to orbit farther from the Heavens as the minor moon. 

Although well told of by elves and [[Fey]], the myth of Endymion did not well-establish the rules of the game the hero played with the moon sisters. Over the years this form has been established using various homeric tellings of the stories, as well as incentivized by bards and general “nerds” who enjoy fantasizing about the battles of the past.
