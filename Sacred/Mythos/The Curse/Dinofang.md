**Dinofang** is a magical heirloom longsword, which has been passed down from parent to child within [[House Dino]] for many generations. Paired with the [[Maian Scabbard]], it is the trademark weapon of many a ruler of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], and has had a grim role in putting down those who succumb to the [[Dragonic Curse]].

Originally forged by [[Stoneshaper Ethel]] in [[899 PT]], under orders from [[Maian Anseri]] it is said to have been made from a [[Sakuya and Ninigi|red dragon's claw]]. It never rusts and cannot break. It has a famous red blade with a green-yellow and silver hilt.

Although it seems to be and weighs the same as a normal (if perfectly balanced) longsword, it can only be lifted and wielded normally by someone who can attune to it: namely, a member or friend of House Dino[^1].

The sword is capable of channeling [[Vitality energy]] into sonic waves of light which can be cast out from its edge, as well as a unique attack spell known as *Starfang* which cloaks the user in a shield which combines both ice and fire.

If it ever falls out of reach, it returns back to the [[Sanctum Most Sacred]] in [[Saurus Castle]], or the nearest unoccupied space, leaving a streaking red trail through the sky.

It is, in reality, a [[Vorpal]] weapon which has been inhibited to ensure its nature. The inhibitor gem which seals its power, made from Ninigi's scale, contains a guardian spirit comprised of the many souls who have wielded the sword. 

There is something of a psionic [[Soul bond|connection]] between itself and all its wielders[^2]. Dreaming while attuned to the sword often causes visions of old battles or figures of Sacred legend to appear throughout otherwise normal dreams.

[^1]: If no one lives who can wield it, it would surely go down the list of royal succession and each of those families, and change its attunement properties accordingly.
[^2]: At dawn, if it isn't in the possession of someone who can wield it, the sword puts out a "distress signal" that can be felt by all living souls who have previously attuned to it, which tells them of its location and who, if anybody, has obtained it.
