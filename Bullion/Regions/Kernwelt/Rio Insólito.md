The **Rio Insólito** ([[Mänyya]] for "the uncanny river") is a river that flows southeast into the [[Upper Kernwelt]] region by way of the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]]. The length of this particular stream is remarkable, and many strange happenings occur near or around it, giving it its name. The place where it originates (as a fork of the [[Rio Castaño]]) is known as the [[Valle Insólito]].

[[Ollom's Creek]] is a fork of the Insólito.
