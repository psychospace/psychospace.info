The **Planet** ([[Oa'Rovi]]: ***Yalagnu***^[Yal-Ashnu]), is the typical [[Shindani]] name of the physical [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet) which is home to the [[The Heavens|Heavens]], where life thrives and where [[psychospace]] is known to harbor an immense power. 

The third-nearest planet to the [[star]] [[Cien]] in the [[Antic Sea]], Yalagnu is a diverse rocky world with peculiar [[gravity]], and two moons, [[Lex]] and [[Ordo]]. 

# History
Since [[Unknown Era|time immemorial]], it has harbored the flow of [[Soul|souls]] throughout the Antic Sea, and possesses complex planar substrata, including sharing the [[The Sheer|influence]] of [[Stronn|another star]], as well as a [[The Fortress|conduit]] to an [[Elseworld|alternate worldline]].

The Planet was architected from the [[Old world|old world]] by the [[Anti|god of gods]][^1]. Her outer atmosphere is known as the [[Dark Sea]], and her most solid surface is known as [[the Below]].

# Alternate worldline
>[!question|bg-c-blue ttl-c] For more information, see [[elseworld]].

Naturally, as the anchor point of [[logic]], a version of the Planet also exists as the "surface" of the [[elseworld]], where [[necrospace]] rules.

# Composition

## Planar stack
The Planet is comprised of what is known as the **planar stack**, a material, physical stratification of [[Chaos]]. The [[Skysea|skyseas]] divide each layer further into distinct areas, each of which are populated by [[Remnant|remnants]]: great continents of floating, suspended rock, which harbor most of the Planet's life.

Vertically layered through an immense [atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth#Stratification) are seven distinct [[Plane#Realm|realms]], each of which holds particular sway over a distinct piece of [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]], a powerful energy that defines and abstracts nature into component pieces. Their thresholds are usually comprised of [[cloudscape|clouds]] which were [[The Gathering|intended]] to prevent collusion between the elements.  ^b65a40

These realms are, from highest to lowest:
- The [[Dark Sea]]
- The [[Umbraid]]
- [[The Above]]
- The [[Wild Blue Yonder]]
- The [[Scarlet Skies]]
- The [[Väräh]]
- and [[The Below]].
