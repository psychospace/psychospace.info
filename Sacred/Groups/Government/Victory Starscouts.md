The **Victory Starscouts** are the local homeland guard of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], usually trained and employed by noble houses or counts in a region. 

They are charged with keeping the peace, enforcing law, and ensuring the "Eternal Victory", under the guiding eye and hand of the local lords. They are operated on a national scale out of the [[Venture Hall]] in [[The Well]].

At one time they served a cartographing purpose, to be sent out the borders of allied remnants and map them for use in tactics, or to eke out encroaching tribes and forces of various groups who would lay claim over the Dino lands. Nowadays that purpose is all but defunct, however camping and orientation is still a part of their training in case they are accidentally transported to unknown lands.

One can join the Starscouts from the age of 15.

In [[Drastic]], they appear in smaller numbers, with most of the guardwork going to the [[Dino Airstyle]] and [[City & Castle]] Guardians. They are still used by the noble houses to defend their homesteads.
