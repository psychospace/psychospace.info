The ***Magnificent*-class**  [[Airship#Amphibious|amphibious airships]] are intended for sailing in poor [[Weather]], especially those around the mysterious center of [[Archipel]] itself, constructed of strong bluewood that give it a stealthy appearance amongst the night sky. 

The ***dd-11*** is a blueprint of this class designed for slightly lower profile, handy when retreating or coming into port, at the cost of weight limit. It's amphibious nature makes it a common-ish ship to see in [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]] following the end of the [[War of the Masters]].
