>[!question|ttl-c bg-c-blue] Not to be confused with a [[Power star|power star]].

A **star** is a celestial object comprised of a [spheroid of plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star) held together with a self-[[Gravity|gravitational]] force. Their interactions bind together [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy). Stars are believed to be impressive beacons of the [[Manifold Seas]], as isolated influences of  [[Out There|the Out There]].

The closest to the [[The Heavens|Heavens]] is known as [[Cien]], defining the [[Antic Sea]].

# Beliefs
 Each star is believed to define a specific manifold "world-sea", marking the domain of its light distinct from everything else. Each star contains a link (a [[portal]]) to the font of [[Vitality energy|vitality energy]] known as [[Mana (plane)|Mana]], as forces of [[Melotte]].

Stars have, since at least the [[Unknown Era]], been associated with a symbol with five points (â˜…), a shape reflected in nature as the typical shape of a [[Power star|power star]].

Apparently, a deity known as the [[Star Maiden]] emerged as a protector over the stars from our [[Welkin|own divinity]], though she has not  been heard of in any significant capacity since the [[Os'Grun]] impact.
