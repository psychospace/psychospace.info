The **Pillar of Progress** is a laboratory within the city of [[Gateway]], constructed for [[Nery Ravenna]]'s use in the search for alternative paths of magical communication. This shining tall building stands out amongst the skyline because it seems as if it were inserted there post-hoc, constructed elsewhere. It seems a sort of clocktower, with green and white accents.

In the Pillar resides a codex of many important figures with [[Messenger dragon|messenger dragons]] throughout the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], as well as partial and complete [[Scroll|scrolls]] of every [[spell]] Nery developed with the help of many other folks, including the *[[rainbow of transport]]* which is used by the [[Tower of Electron]], another one of Nery's creations. Within the Tower, Nery also has a [[mirror of translation]].
