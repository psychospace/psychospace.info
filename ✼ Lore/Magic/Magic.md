**Magic**, also called *arcana*, borne of [[Psychospace]], is a broad term covering effects not naturally produced by physics or standard natural laws, requiring purpose, instructions, and duration. At its base level, the study of magic is the will to understand and control the [[Logic]] of the universe through respecting the [[Divine Equation]].

>[!note]
This article primarily covers "old magic", or magic as it was understood prior to the proliferation of [[Psion|psions]], although most of their spells, codified or not, also fall under these classifications.
# Types
The magic system generally takes three forms: latent effects, cast effects, and intent effects. A fourth form, termed [[new magic]], has emerged, although this classification is not mutually exclusive with the others. All magic naturally witnessed by creatures can fit into these categories with enough specificity. 

### Latent
**Latent magic** is the most common form, existing nearly everywhere simultaneously, and being affected as easily as the whims of emotion themselves. It is the natural consequence of the pervasiveness of psychospace, able to affect the consequences of actions or [[Logic]] in innumerable, minor ways. It is for this reason, that it exists in all spaces and at all times, that it is often simplified as a concept to the "will of the [[Divinity|gods]]". 

The laws of psychospace as it affects and is affected by [[Soul|souls]] and the physical world (such as through [[Off-wave|off-waves]] and [[Psinomenon|psinomena]]) create latent magic as a byproduct. For example, latent magic might include a crowd's cheering affecting the speed of a racer, a brother being able to suddenly sense when his sister is in danger, or the death of an [[Eidolon]] causing an emotional ripple effect in its community. 

Its fleeting and manipulable nature mean that creatures with more impactful [[Senzai|senzai]] will be able to affect it in stronger manners.

### Cast
**Cast magic** is the second most-common, created generally by humanoids and powerful creatures, executing [[Compilation|compiled]] [[Psychic code|psychic code]] ([[spell|spells]]) as created through various means. Generally, when one refers to "magic users", they are referring to users of cast magic.  It is essentially the natural evolution of latent magic: belief in power *creating* power.

Cast magic is the form of magic that can be taught, learned, experimented, believed in, passed on, inherited, or bestowed. Generally speaking, cast magic is considered as having a [[Arcane complexity|level]] of complexity in accordance with its effects. Many spells are also divided into the eight [[Classical Schools]].

In order to cast magic, one must be able to overcome their inner [[Light (property)#Darkness|Darkness]]. This allows them to obtain a perspective on the divine equation.

In general, cast magic is created in either miraculous or arcane forms, both sourced from the Divine Equation.

* **Miraculous magic**, also called "divine" magic, is sourced from observing nature, or retelling stories, and believing or creating changes through veneration. In contrast to arcane casters, divine casters accept the world as it is and make changes through allowing the world's powers to flow through them. Miracles are generally reliant on [[Divinity|gods]], patrons, or divine portfolios, as prayer is capable of generating these abilities.
- **Arcane magic**, also known as "textual" magic, is sourced from directly interpreting the Equation's results to discern how a process comes about, and more specifically how someone might do something new with it. In contrast to divine casters, arcane casters seek to change the world through their own knowledge, rather than through faith. When compared to miracles, arcane studies generally find themselves limited by study.

The knowledge of cast magic is often collated into works known as [[hexicon|hexicons]]. 

A spellcaster wishing to share their findings or create consumable copies of their research can decode certain spells back into user-agnostic forms, usually as [[Scroll|scrolls]]. Cast magic in specific forms is subject to the [[Viewpoint property]]. 

[[Enchantment|Enchanters]] and [[Artifice|artificers]] use *cast magic* to manifest a latent or intent magic effect, allowing such creations to be much more persistent than the transitory effects of most spells, sometimes even allowing these effects to manifest cast magic themselves. This is how **magic items** are created. 

### Intent
**Intent magic** is the least common, but exists in high densities under certain conditions. An intent effect is that which is created by a creature through an "access route" (such as an organ, a [[Curse]], or potent connection) to a specific element of the Equation, known as an aspect. Most obviously, the [[Domain|Domain]] of an [[immortal]] is one such source. This effect is generally without the need to so intricately define it; the *intent* to bring about an effect is enough to create the effect for such creatures.

Certain creatures, often the byproduct of magic themselves, exude auras or abilities that are have magical effects as a result of dense or immensely powerful and deeply ingrained [[Echo|psychic data]] within their soul that automatically and consistently exists and executes.  Examples of intent magic manifestations are a [[revenant]]'s automatic rejuvenation, an [[Angel]]'s singing, or a [[Dragon]]'s breath.

This also extends to creatures which linger due to powerful intentions, such as [[Ghost|ghosts]].

It is identified by its clear resilience to [[antimagic]], requiring special rites of [[abjuration]], such as [[Exorcism]], to negotiate. No one rite is capable of interrupting all forms of intent magic.

# Clade
A **clade** is an individual study or intriguing topic of magic.

# Legality
Due to magic's ubiquity and immense potential, the legality of certain kinds of magic is often questioned. Across most of the world, these have been given colors.

The terms red, white, black, and gray magics are categorizations from legal [[hexicon|hexicons]].

### White magic
A **white magic** is magic that is legal to perform in almost all cases, where its use wouldn't break any other law.

Examples include [[healing]] spells, and most formally-defined [[Cantrip|cantrips]].

### Black magic
**Black magic** is magic that is typically not legal to perform or teach, due to the danger to autonomy, person, or environment as a result of its unpredictable effects.

Examples include [[wild magic]] or [[new magic]] in many jurisdictions.

### Gray magic
A **gray magic** is magic that is explicitly legal to be used, though typically not taught except by specialists, only used under official, permissive pretense.

Examples include [[modify memory]].

### Red magic
**Red magic** is magic that is explicitly legal to be taught, but its use is disincentivized or only legal in self-defense.

Examples include most attacking spells.
