**Illusion** is the [[Magic]] study of **illusionists**, and is one of the eight [[Classical Schools]] of magic, interlinked with [[Divination]]. Illusion is the study of deceptive magics which baffle the mind, drawing on the tapestry of [[psychospace]], and preventing certain information from being perceived, accessed, or obtained.

With illusions, the impossible can appear to come to life, and one's appearance can be molded as easy as speaking a single word. Some use this ability in a benign manner, to entertain and tell stories. Others use it to its true, malicious potential, fooling enemies into stepping through a bridge which doesn't exist. 

It is highly related to the natural energies of the [[elseworld]], where illusion molds the environment itself.

Illusion, like its interlinked study, is often highly subtle, difficult to see the immediate effects of. Illusionists have been historic fraudsters, though on the other hand have been underdogs and heroes, able to bring about revolution through the right lie at the right time.
