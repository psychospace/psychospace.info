**Kitsune** are a foxlike #sapient  ancestry of [[Kinfolk|kinfolk]]. Many revere [[Seiu]] as their creator, and originate from the [[Naciente]] nation of [[Seiu-Sabi]].

# Origins
Kitsune have extremely ancient origins, beginning with the [[First Magicians|First Ones]], who had contracted [[Uzia calora|uzia calora]].

![[Seiu#Mythos|no-h]]

It is sometimes suggested that kitsune were the originator of the [[Primal curse]]. 

# Traits
## Shapechanging
The [[Body|bodies]] of kitsune have two forms they can assume at will: 
* Their true form closest resembles the description of kinfolk, having furred skin and the head-structure of a fox, bearing a number of tails equal to the kitsune's 'enlightenment' level (up to 9). 
* Their alternate form varies based on heritage:
    * it is usually a *tailless* form, which resembles another ancestry typical to their place of upbringing.
    * Other heritages possess a beast form, allowing them to assume the pure form of a fox.

Most kitsune desire, in some respect, to conceal their true form, seeing it as inalienable and as precious as their [[True name (concept)|true name]], similar in outlook to [[changeling|changelings]]. As shapechangers themselves, kitsune see the true form as a sacred piece of themselves, not to be revealed against one's will.

Their twin forms lead kitsune to often have complex ideas of what comprises their identity, sometimes seeing their forms as alternate entities, or as sides of the same [[soul]]. 

## Personality

Kitsune are characteristically sharp-witted and sharpeyed, delighting in mimicry and empathy. Perhaps in part due to their nature, they form distinctly strong social [[Soul bond|bonds]] in spite of instincts for trickery and duplicity. A meeting of two kitsune often leads to one another toying with the prospects of one another.

In recorded history, the oldest living kitsune (as of [[1251 PT]]), [[Augen]] of [[Pinwheel]], is estimated to be around 3200 years old if not older. A kitsune has never perished of old age, and so it is unknown what their upper limit truly could be if any.
