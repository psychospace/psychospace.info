# Special Appearances

[A crack of thunder in the distance seems to echo perfectly and fill [[Einon Stadium|the arena]] with the sound.  ***BABOOMMMM…*** You look over, nervous, at the [[Ghost storm|purple storm]] on the horizon. It's nowhere close. Where did that come from?]

[It begins to cloud over, the wind picking up. What's going on? The [[Velocis Dino|queen]] told [[S4|you]] that the Tower would assure the day would be peaceful, would be sunny, that the weather was due to be fine… And in that moment, you hear a whistling sound of warning from the [[Tower of Electron]]. It's a siren none of you have heard in your lives.]

[The sky darkens quickly, filled with dark black rainclouds. You gaze upwards, anticipating rain drops. And you see from within these dark clouds, small markers of electric blue light, arcing slowly, or is it… gliding in formation… as a subtle HUM begins to thrum throughout the city. That siren continues.]

[Suddenly, a wave of rainbow energy from the Tower of Electron radiates outward. Your eyes are blinded for a moment as the wave passes overhead, and the [[Cien|sun]] is revealed again. The dark clouds vanish… but beyond their veil, you are not expecting what you see.]

[You see a humongous dark [[airship|warship]], a massive zeppelin airvessel, filling the whole sky with its dark-gray balloon and eight black draconid wings: its helm, a twisted spire of black translucent crystal, pointed out over the arena, eclipsing the sky and sending waves of rainbow light all over the city from its shadow. Along its span and its foredeck you see cannons, dozens, hundreds of black cannons of a narrow design pointed down at you, with three massive [[Filistec|filistecs]] marking each side of the balloon. You see along its side a name. This vessel is named in some foreign script, and it bears down on you, circling the stadium.]

\[[[Shohei Integra|Sho]] mutters something, reading the name. "[[Charybda|Charybdis]]." That's the Charybdis…]

[You see two, three, four similar zeppelin airvessels appear, each smaller than the "CHARYBDIS". They all circle the vessel, offering support. This is to say nothing of the four ships you see currently docked with the CHARYBDIS, and that's on the side facing the Stadium. How large is whatever this force is….?]

[The [[Tyranno Re Ursus|king]] suddenly wavers. There's a moment of recognition in his eyes, and [[Succotash]] moves to stand ahead of him as they are surrounded by [[City & Castle]] guard, armed with heavy greatshields. [[Lazuli Dino|Linnaeus]] is suddenly stranded, trapped in a section of the stadium where he cannot easily get away. He, too, is surrounded by C&Cs, but it is [[Ildy]] who stands closest and firmest. He looks up to the box where you all are sitting, hoping against hope. But of what Linnaeus hoped, it cannot be said.]

[The siren ends. Something is happening. You all stare up at the airship as it stops moving forward, its wings halted like oars left trailing in the air. It turns, before pitching downwards and bearing down directly over the Stadium. The audience screams, but again the ship halts, hangs there in the air.]

[Suddenly, from the ship, a loud "BOOM". You see - flash, flash FLASH, FLASH! - some glinting object moving faster than vision can detect before SLAMMING into the earth at the center of the stadium. BRAKOOM! Smoke and dust is sent up and fills the air, clouding your perspective.]

[The shockwave sends people into a confusion, shouting and crying. As the smoke clears, the shape becomes clearer. It's some kind of black, armored ball. What must be layers and layers of scales, oozing some kind of pink liquid, impacting the center of the stadium, making a crater. This meteor sits there, having landed on top of Maester [[Scot Swiftmeat|Scot]]. His body is crushed beneath the weight of this thing, and his arm flimsily reaches out then goes limp. His last words before he passes out were, "That… bad, huh…?"]

[There's ill-timed feedback  — HUAAANG — as the [[staff of magnification]] goes dead. For a moment, no one seems to know what to say or do but scream, terrified.]

## The Champion

[The confusion compounds. The ball…. stands. The crowd quiets, murmuring in fear. The ball is not a ball, but a moving, standing, suit of onyx-black dragonscale armor, full plate on gigantic flesh. There seems not a single hole in this suit of armor, not a single chink in its pristine surface. As it rises, rubble the size of baseballs slide off its back and make dents in the stone below. Pink liquid oozes slowly from where the neck would be, dripping slowly onto the ground.]

[On its back sits a remarkable greatsword of a design you've never quite seen before. It has two sharp pink-metal single-edged blades placed back to back on the same tough black stone hilt, the blades of differing sizes and shapes: one overly large and sharp, and one smaller, the tip curved and wisped like the end of a leaf. The blades shudder and shake in place on this hilt,  sort of repelling one another like a magnet. You see that the greatsword seems to already be dripping with whatever pink liquid is coming off the armor. In a sheath on its waist sits a white-bladed longsword with molded diamond-shaped holes along its sawtoothed length, almost as if the metal was twisted into that form like a helix. All along the longsword are ugly black burn marks, impurities from the forging process, each shining with an eerie red gleam, as if its creation gave it a distaste for light.]

[The armor stands slowly, its chestpiece rising off the floor last, as if standing from kneeling. There's a cracking noise each time a vertebra of the armor changes angle, as if it was frozen and is just now breaking out of the ice. When it finally stands tall, the armor, in both height and width, dwarfs the size of any humanoid you can see, especially the [[Dwarf|dwarves]].]

[Suddenly, there's a sound that fills your ears. Like nails on a chalkboard, mixed with a sudden igniting flame and the screams of hundreds, whistling on the wind. This sound rips forth from the armor as it shakily raises a gauntlet, its fingers pressed together. Wind around the armor picks up and the pink liquid oozing down its form suddenly picks up into a vortex, a whirling wind around the armor, and suddenly the pink blood turns to pink embers to a raging pink fire, incinerating the area where the head might be. The fingers then snap, and suddenly, the sound ends, and there is a head. Floating freely above the neck of the armor, erupting from nowhere, is a woman's face.]

[She has fair skin, sparking green eyes, and red, long hair, which is in disarray, floating down over her armor. She's bearing a wicked, toothy grin. By your estimates, she may stand anywhere from 8 to 11 feet tall, with room to spare for guesses: broad shoulders, no neck, in inhumanly gigantic armor, her chest rippling with muscles, her ripped cape blowing in the wind. Alexios… in your family's home of Dawndust you've heard many a tale of the dead turned alive again in pursuit of a single-minded goal, chaining the soul to a fate, however ill-advised. There can be no doubt in your mind. This is a dullahan, down to every last letter in the myth. And if that is so, there is no stopping what she wants of you.]

[This intimidating figure brushes her hair out of her eyes, stares right up at the king, and mutters:]

>>[!quote|author] [[Hazel Sobol]]
>>Ah, yes…. here we are. The games can finally begin now that all the pieces lie together…

[Her eyes dance downwards, licking her lips, as she reaches below her massive legs and takes the staff of magnification, spins the crystal, and begins speaking.] 

>Hello, ladies, gentlemen, and otherwise. Welcome. Do not see this welcome insincere. No; we extend our heartfelt thanks. Willing or not, you have allowed all of us here to become audience to the greatest lie of all. It is my humble pleasure to have you all here to see it, and, of course, my honor to be the one to at last unearth it. After all, they do say seeing is believing.

[You hear people in the box to your left rummaging, running out back and down the stairs to head to the exits. Her body suddenly tenses and slams her foot down, her head spinning 180 degrees. The screaming sound returns as the fire engulfing her head intensifies. She stares daggers at the back row, at each of you, and especially at the people who just stood up, then raises her fist.]

>*HEY!* I see you all making a break for your things. What, too busy to see the show? Scared for your life, all of a sudden? Caught you at a bad time? 
>
>Sit… the fuck… down, or you'll ruin it for everyone. That goes for all of the spare meat in the front rows, too. Y'all paid for this. Get your fuckin' money's worth!

[Nine figures drop from the airship, landing on the edge of the Stadium's wall. Each wears a cloak not dissimilar to the cape the armored creature is wearing, obscuring their identities. They each hold some kind of weapon, and have black-feathered wings sprouting from their back. The dullahan spins her head 360 degrees, grinning at each of them.]

>[[Nortian Conspiracy|Away team]] present and accounted for? Excellent. Keep these butts in seats, fellas. Now, let's start the show.
>
>In case you high-strungs didn't catch that, let me make things clear before the blood muddies it up. You miserable pawns better straighten out and keep your eyes on me. Don't waste your chance to survive the war. Don't die yet; we're just starting to get good. I'm sure any of the upper-crusts here will wanna hold onto their pearls same way they want their heartbeats, huh? Hnnmmm. You all are unguided cowards.
>
>But do not misunderstand my words. You are not hostages to the Empire. You will be released quite shortly, quite alive too, if there aren't any objections raised by members of the crowd. It's a show you're here for, after all.

[Buster does a point to the king, then circles her finger outward, to all of his attending court members: [[Cefal]], [[Mistral Taylor Burgitsk|Mistral Taylor]], [[Succotash]]...]

>In fact, any of the dull-witted sub-royal brats in the back row might actually want to go make sure their affairs are in order. Compatriots, let those cowards run. But … of course….
>
>I don't have to tell you twice who to stop.
>
>Now…. to introductions, of course. You must know the players if you are to play, after all….

## Into the Abyss
>I am Buster [[Hazel Sobol]]… the *Champion Serena*. I am a knightess of the [[Great Nortian Empire|Empire of Nortia]], champion of [[Yofora]]'s moon and sun, blessed of [[Uforia]], captain of the [[Army of Euphony]], an [[undead]] masterwork of the [[NIMROD|Imperial Research Division]], trusted blade of the Empress, and the beloved of her daughter. Of these titles, I am most proud of the last…
>
>She is my betrothed, yes… everything I do, I do for [[Serena Nortia|Serena]].

[Buster appears peering into her hand, somehow dumbstruck, but she then closes it in a fist and grins from ear to ear again.]

>Nothing I have just told you is a lie. See for yourself. I went beyond death… beyond the world of flesh and blood… I did all of it for her. I have spilled so much blood… countless souls and countless curses. With luck, we might only spill a little blood today. This, too, I do for Serena. I do it all for the Empire, for Nortia and her heir...
>
>One thing I do deal in is truth. At the request of our little sponsor, I must tell you that. I deal in lies and facts. The world should be purged of lies. A lie grants no one permanent strength. A lie is a one-way fall into the chasm of the Hells, an antagonistic action begetting recourse. So, now--

[More motion from throughout the crowd. You can hear from just beyond the Stadium wall, guards gathering. The hooded figure immediately behind you all murmurs something worriedly. Buster looks throughout the crowd, stamps her foot down again, and shouts:]

>What, impatient? Fine! I'll rip life from limb faster, then! Ultimatum right away, hunh?! Give me the prince!

[There is a moment of dead air. The prince scrambles to his feet as Ildy suddenly summons his shield, the Drastic Measure, and Linnie moves to hide behind him and it. Buster beckons him come forward, but he does not move, so her head spins and she steps away.]

>You may think each of you important, but that is a lie. In fact, we haven't blown the place to bits because of one singular person.

[Buster again points at Linnie and snaps her fingers, grinning from ear to ear. The screaming sound returns, but this time it is different. It is almost screaming a song. Some kind of chant.]

>The prince — now *there* is the true prize. There lies the worst lie of this world. The lie that has followed him since his birth must be extinguished.
>
>And I will steal him away, for Lady Serena. His life shall be freed from pain. His blood will be mine, and mine his. And… with Serena to help me, his inner dragon will be purified, and it, too, will no longer be a lie. It will be no more…

[The crowd's noise rises. Buster shifts again, and puts her hand to her ear in a cocky pose. She says:]

>What's that I hear? The "inner dragon"? Some of you are even right on the money. But you refuse to believe the truth.
>
>But yes, dear people of Sacred. Your prodigal son… is indeed host to that old [[curse]]. He is a burning stick of dynamite waiting to go off and level the city, or perhaps the whole damn remnant...
>
>While your precious eidolon has kept it from progressing, truth is…way things are now, the fire set to ignite him can never be put out until it burns him to cinder. This… I say to you this is the truth. That curse… It never left. It has never been truly suppressed. Only just there, just beneath the surface! A shining light, ready to burst into a devastating display!
>
>We offer you something you cannot refuse. We shall cure the legendary dragonic curse by stealing Linnaeus away to Nortia. He shall be treated as one of us, and then, he shall be free of the lies you chain him by!
>
>In fact, let me put it this way. You want to see the truth, dear people? We are going to reveal what this kingdom has suppressed all his life. The [[dragonic curse]] shall be made plain to see. The ultimate curse, revealed, right here and now!

# Warning Shots
[Buster tumbles across the arena. A brave C&C steps forward to stop her, but her greatsword flashes from her back and is upon him in a moment, cutting straight through chain and steel as she rages forward, leaving the suddenly lifeless body behind. She is ripping through flesh and bone, one, two, three, five, seven, ten bodies of guards falling before her blade on her way to the prince, practically at a running pace. It is a horrific display. Nothing even slows her down. She doesn't even use two hands for her greatsword. Everyone is left dumbstruck, staring in abject horror.]

[Ildy stands in her way, but she runs to his side all of a sudden and her armored boots skid on the ground, sending sparks up that distract and blind him. She shoves off the ground and raises her blade in an overhand strike. Linnie tries to draw Dinofang, but his hands aren't as fast as his mind as he stops drawing the sword and stares in shock, screaming at the gore and at the dullahan. Buster's blade wavers as she cackles.]

>And now, the grand finale!

[The blade falls, you shut your eyes… but the blow glides off his skin, suddenly. Buster gazes up. Ildy glows with a purple aura, Drastic Measure suddenly flashing with orange as Linnie's body shines. He's been protected. The Drastic Measure suddenly bursts forth with a heart shaped shockwave, knocking Buster off balance, and Ildy follows it up with two more bursts, disarming her and knocking her to her feet.]

>>[!quote|author] [[Ildy]]
"You'd… you'd better back off! He's not going anywhere. My shield will protect him until his death."
>
>>[!quote|author] [[Hazel Sobol]]
>That so, huh?

[Hazel stands, retrieving her sword. The world seems to be holding its breath. She paces, slowly. The sword grinds along the ground. Buster surveys Ildy. Surveys the prince. A smile twitches at her lips. Then she looks at Ildy says:]

>>[!quote|author] [[Hazel Sobol]]
>You, [[eidolon]], are not deathproof.

[Ildy holds his ground, bursts her again with the shield, until she's kneeling, the armor on her knees skidding and sparking along the ground. His expression is resolute, his voice loud.] 

>>[!quote|author] [[Ildy]]
>"Silence, undead brute! I am unshaken by your threats! To get to Linnaeus, you must stop me, you must DO the impossible, stop the unstoppable. This is a fool's errand! You have WASTED your time! ...You have greatly angered me... and... and... I am his BEST FRIEND, you-!! *You*--!!"

[Hazel brings her gaze up again, smiles maliciously.]

>>[!quote|author] Hazel Sobol
>"Your life could have been spared, eidolon. You may well have lived to remain guardian of this city the day it t'were razed. But so you have proven…
>>
>>This is not what shall come to pass. Whatever you want, horseface. It's your funeral."

[Ildy seems somewhat fazed by that comment.]

>>[!quote|author] Ildy's last words
>>"Only the gods could strike us down. That is our bond! Do you hear me, wench?! Do you?! That is the true nature of our friendship! That is US together: **the strength of a great prince, *and the strength of his great people!*** How can you EVER hope to shake us?!"

^860f97

[Another burst from the shield. But this time, Hazel doesn't budge. She just grins, ear to ear. Ildy wavers.]

>>[!quote|author] Hazel
>"It was fun while it lasted…"

[Hazel raises her non-sword arm open palmed, then suddenly clenches her grip tightly into a fist. Ildy's eyes dance upwards suddenly, panicked. The next events happen so rapidly as if time were moving in slow motion.]

[Ildy suddenly yells out:]

>>[!quote|author] Ildy
"*LINN--!*"

***==[BOOOOOOM!!!!]==***

[A shot rings out from on high and hits Ildy, coming from somewhere on the deck of the airship. It echoes through the streets, heard for miles round. Ildy is staggered backwards, and drops the shield. A teal object glows, smoking from his forehead.]

[Ildy falls back, lands on the ground, drops the shield. He doesn't seem to be responding. His form distorts, glitches. His gaze falls to Hazel, standing in front of him. Buster Hazel, in one motion, raises and then SLAMS her greatsword down onto him, through the center of his body. His body snaps cleanly in half, distorting as it goes. The pieces fall, fall to the ground, before it collectively fades into dust, collecting in a small light heart-shaped pearl.]

[Suddenly, all at once, it hits you. **Ildy is dead.** The crowd stirs. Shudders. A [[Off-wave|wave]] of sorrow burrows down deep inside each of you, deeper than you realize such a thing might. Each of you immediately feel heavy heartache as the psychospace of Drastic reacts to the eidolon's death. [[Shohei Integra|Sho]] is knocked unconscious from the stress, coughing up blood.]

[The heart gem, the last remainder of Ildy, cracks open, and there is a light green smoke coming from within that spills out - smoke from the weapon's magic. When the smoke clears, [[Wand of Mythos|a wand with the head of a star]] is left behind. Hazel kicks the wand away, grinning.]

## The Unstoppable Stopped

>>[!quote|author] Hazel
>>A valiant effort… but futile, in the end, 'gainst the power of a [[psychobullet]].
>>
>>An unecessary loss, too. "At every step, he followed orders." I hope your parents put that on his grave.

>>[!quote|author] Linnie
>>"Y-you… didn't… Ildy… [[Exponen]] guide me… oh, *gods*…”]

[The prince is at a loss for words. He collapses to his knees, in despair. Naturally, being royal, he is gravely connected to the existence of Ildy. You see red lightning starting to emanate from his body, some kind of shuddering energy. Hazel stands back and gives a hearty, manic, insane laugh. Sheathing her sword. Guards begin to rush forward in panic but each are stopped by one of the cloaked figures, who in turn swoop down over the crowd, cut off a hand or foot, and then vanish back to atop the coliseum.]

>>[!quote|author] Hazel
>This is the mercy I grant you, Prince. A world without safety. A world where you can spread your wings. A world where you can be however powerful you can imagine, where you can enact true and ultimate change for the universe as you sit the throne of creation. Where you can breathe freely, finally. A world where only you rule as the whillo that is your birthright.

[The prince howls in anger.]
>>[!quote|author] Linnaeus
>>***"That's enough!!"***

[He raises [[Dinofang]] and swings from a low position. Hazel hardly dodges and is cut across the face with searing radiance. She doesn't budge, even as she bleeds from everywhere along her front. Observant patrons notice something in her face: she's smiling maliciously, and even laps the blood from her palm. Dinofang's hilt shines for a moment with an uneasy green light.]

You have given me a scar I shall savor every day… charged with the emotions of the indignant.

>>[!quote|author] [[Lazuli Dino]]
>"You cruel… heartless, arrogant bastard! What have you done?!"

>>[!quote|author] [[Hazel Sobol]]
>"The better question is… what will you do now?"

[The prince yells out, and attacks as he was trained, in the renegade sword style of his mother. Hazel takes the next hit but pulls her greatsword from her back steadily. The blade lances out from her back and blocks Dinofang, but her guard breaks slightly under the blade's weight and magic. Buster grits her teeth, raising the greatsword once again just in time as the prince powers up the blade with a smite and slams it against the greatsword's blade, sliding and binding it. A short swordfight plays out. Every time the prince seems to be gaining footing, Hazel hasn't budged an inch and hasn't pressed advantages. From where you're sitting, you suddenly notice a shining spark from [[Saurus Castle]] in the distance, and something streaking through the sky.]

[The two continue to engage their blades. The crowd cheers and jeers as the footing swings this way and that. But its like Buster hasn't even drawn breath since the fight started. Then, she's caught off-guard by a feint. Then, another one. She's slipping. Her focus is slipping.

[Then, an opening. Her hand was left out of position. Linnie roars in anger, swings, strikes her head horizontally. It spins freely, and she yells in hedonistic pain and pleasure combined. Then, he pulls his stance through, slams his foot down, and stabs her through the middle of the skull. Dinofang arcs with red electricity and the green light dies down. She looks aghast as her jaw falls slack, pink blood oozing from both sides. He pulls her head from unholy fire as it resists, and collapses to the ground, sobbing as he stabs her all the way through the heart. Her body goes limp and collapses to its knees, then falls flat. Linnie pulls Dinofang out of her and he cradles the sword, crying from stress.]

[The flesh of the head fades away, revealing a pink skull. The sound of blood in your ears dies down, and… All seems calm. All that can be heard in the arena, its breath held, is Linnaeus sobbing.]

[The king stands, raises his staff. "Cheers for His Royal Highness, Linnaeus, and his bravery!" he proclaims. And the crowd begins nervously clapping, all the same.]

[But just as soon…]

[Then… the body lurches forward again. Slides silently until its body is upright. Grabs the Prince. All in the span of a moment. His face suddenly drops. Prince Linnie is caught in a full wrestling carry as his back is cracked and probably broken several times over. The Prince screams bloody murder, and you all reel at the noise. The king stares in horror. The crowd screams. The Prince's grip falters and he drops Dinofang tip down into the dirt, his hand going limp.]

[The woman's head reappears in a swirling, raging pink flame. Her expression is equal parts upset, happy, and pure rage. When it does so, the crowd is silent again, cognizant once more of this woman.]

>You must've missed the part where I said I couldn't die. WELL, fair mistake. But a fatal one for most.
>
>Well? I'm not disappointed. You fight like nothing matters, brat! Serena will love you. Proof that that [[Ikabod Caruso|crochety old mage]]'s papers were right on the money, as expected. You are an aberrant madman, barely a prince in your style. I like it, but my opinion is no matter. Your temper will certainly need refining, wouldn't you say? We can straighten you out, good enough.

[The prince's back is cracked again, Hazel's grip tightening. Red blood seeps through his mythril chain shirt, mixing uncomfortably with pink down Hazel's arm, as Lin is lifted with one arm to the sky.]

# The Sparks Fly

>>[!quote|author] [[Hazel Sobol]]
> People of Sacred, look no further to the GREATEST WEAPON YOUR LEADERS HAVE! <br>***THEIR OWN SON!***

^6d35df

\[[[Ink of Angelblood|One of the cloaked figures]] pulls out a [[Life Line|short yellow blade]] and holds it skyward. A [[Moonbeam|flash of light]], miniscule and yet fast, shoots from the top of this blade into the clouds.]

[A shining black flame with white fringe, starts shining outward from the top of the stadium.]

[A massive thumping, ominous noise can be heard from the sky as Buster holds a limp, fight-less Linnaeus skyward with one mighty arm. The clouds part and from on high, a pillar of radiant white light envelops Buster and Linnie. The crowd gasps. Buster's armor cracks and shudders revealing more layers of black and she yowls in pleasure, while Linnie suddenly bursts outward with orange and yellow energy, as Ildy's final protective barrier breaks and bursts like a rubber suit inflating and popping. The Prince's final scream is heard as the world goes completely and totally white.]

A loud chime is heard as [[Red Spark|a great red-white light]], like a massive flare, emerges from the epicenter of the blast, shooting high, high up into the sky. It can be seen from nearly everywhere in Sacred:
- [[Maline Tower|Ikabod's tower]], empty and dusty with an unknown face sweeping the halls and keeping house, barely noticing the sudden pillar of light blaring out the window until they pass an open window and drop to their knees in despair --
- [[The Twist Ending]] bar in [[Ladybug]]: whose patrons all turn to a red glint on the horizon as the air grows cold --
- [[Giant|Giants]] of both ice and fire in the castle in the clouds atop the [[Father Sakura]] in [[Cherryheart]] mutter hushed curses, in disbelief
- The [[Claytowers]] in [[Midzone]], where [[Victory Starscouts|Starscouts]] pass around binoculars to get a handle on what they're seeing --
- Stoic black and white checker-coat clerics watching a deep basin of gray water flicker with images in [[Destiny Cathedral]], turning away in suppressed fright --
- The children of two disparate families in [[Wisfer]]'s [[Silverfields]], stop their playing at being heroes as a toy rolls across the ground and comes to a stop --
- [[Paletta]]'s manor shudders as the lord watches the horizon change as they work on the repair to their manor, setting down their materials in awe --
- [[The Leprechaun's Haul]]'s patrons seem in sudden disarray as they begin losing streaks while screams are heard from the streets outside; meanwhile, on a parapet, the [[Ashton Orpheus Albatros|Ace of Gold]] shakes his head, unwelcome tears falling from his eyes --
- And finally, an armored knight floating above the city of [[Drastic]] --No, flying — stops, stock still. She falters, no tears yet. Soundlessly, the knight murmurs the words,
>[!quote|author] [[Velocis Dino]]
>“Two steps. I was only two steps short.”

[Energy, light, hate, love, absolute, unyielding, awakening, RAGE builds alarmingly quickly and blinds you, bringing you back to your perspective…]

[Gradually, the white light dies down. You all are still here. Buster's laugh begins to cry out as a huge shockwave is sent out from the Prince, smashing glass and stone alike. You hear something resonant faintly, like the tolling of heavenly bells. When the smoke clears and the moonbeam ends (prematurely), a wounded Buster is holding the Prince Linnaeus, but not quite.]

# Weeping Whillo
[Red electricity arcs up and down his trembling form. Shining red horns, scattered red-gray facial discoloration, red fangs, and crazy yellow eyes. Scales run down his arms and legs, and some talons have already sprouted from his hands and feet. His skin is speckled, turning gray. Two burnt, ashy, but definitely draconic wings sprout from his upper back. A long, thin, chain-like dragon tail with steel spines erupts from his lower back and winds its way just ahead of Hazel's knees, pooling onto the ground.]

[Linnie is in immense pain as the transformation is finally unveiled. This pain is vocalized as a sort of reptilian yell, sending out another thunder-like crack of energy throughout the space as electricity arcs off his body for what is essentially him saying "ow". Some citizens are hit by this electricity and are incinerated, red fire washing over them and vaporizing them in an instant. This is an immensely powerful being, and even as far away as you are, even those who can't cast magic can "feel" the power level of this creature rocketing higher by the second. You don't need detect magic to understand that this being is impossible.]

[It was your friend Linnaeus. And now, is it still?]

[Hazel laughs.]

>>[!quote|author] Hazel
>So you see…. the ultimate curse has already reached you…

[The prince croaks out.]

>>[!quote|author] [[Lazuli Dino]]
>*"Mom!! Dad!!….Everyone… You all, I'm so… so very sorry…"*

>>[!quote|author] [[Hazel Sobol]]
Sacred… welcome to this grandest of games…

[Buster thrusts the Prince up and into the air, and suddenly, a prismatic [[Globe of invulnerability|globe]] forms around the Prince, cast in formation by all of the ships docked with the Charybdis, with beams that fire continuously towards him. Many layers of translucent, heavenly energy enrapture and contain him, although shockwave pulses of energy still emanate outward — BOOM, BOOM, OOUF — like contained explosions behind concrete. Linnie passes out as the globe fills with red lightning once, twice, three times, and each time it doesn't breach the globe, although you do see it flicker. Suddenly, a WHOOSHING noise is heard as a cylindrical beam of soft blue light envelops the globe, shot from beneath the Charybdis. The globe slowly rises into the air, taking rubble, dirt, and other things into the beam. Buster steps away.]

>The first turn is complete, Sacred. It is your move now…. It is your de--

[Another slam of earth hits the center of the arena, throwing dust up, as out of this dustcloud [[Wings of the End|a white greatsword]] swings at Hazel with an almost invisible attack.]

[*SCHWINK!* The buster's left arm is instantly severed at the shoulder. White light spills from cracks forming in the armored limb, before the arm suddenly engulfs with energy and implodes into white butterflies, eradicated by radiant light. Hazel's mood drops as she whirls around. Queen [[Velocis Dino|Velocis]] stands before her, brandishing her greatsword as it floats ahead of her, her radiant gold wings unfurled behind her, the sun shining on her adamantine platemail and diamond and steel crown. Tears stream down her face, glittering in the sunlight.]

[Velocis shudders with rage and shouts, 

>[!quote|author] [[Velocis Dino]]
"Give me back my son or I'm going to wish you into oblivion."(!)

[Hazel recoils, bleeds everywhere. Spits out a tooth as it regrows in her mouth. Buster takes two steps back, breathing heavy. She seems to have lost a bit of her bravado.]

>"Queen Velocis! Early to the party, I see."

>>[!quote|author] [[Velocis Dino]]
 "Damn you. Damn your party! Give him BACK!"

>>[!quote|author] Hazel
"Well, now. All's fair, as they say! Your son's got quite the kick to him, don't you think?! You really want that to end the war before it even begins? If I vanish, what do you think we'll do to your boy?! What do you think it will do?!! [[Wish|Wishes]] don't work that way! You can't end a war with a wave of a wand!!"

[Velocis glows with ethereal light, as Hazel's arm grows back, partially damaged armor already growing like dragonscale and covering the regrown limb. The Queen barks,]

>>[!quote|author] Velocis
"How did you discover this?! WHEN?!" 

[Hazel shrugs, confident.]

>>[!quote|author] Hazel
>"Why does that matter, Your Grace? We were right, and now, the lie is over, Dino! The truth has been revealed. Your son was never the kind child you raised him as. He was always, and will forevermore be, a dragon… And soon, he'll be one of us, too."

[Velocis comes at Buster swinging. Buster's ready, and regrows her arm to catch the blade and whack it away with her shortsword at her waist. Wings of the End crashes into the earth before sliding out gracefully. Buster's not so sure she can take the queen, but the globe begins to rise steadily into the air.]

[Velocis turns her attention to it, again swinging at it like mad.]

>>[!quote|author] Velocis
>"WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? WHY ISN'T ANYTHING WORKING?! WHAT IN THE HEAVENS IS HAPPENING TO US?"

[She slams her hands on the globe, casting any manner of magic against it. Waves of color wash over the globe but nothing seems to stop it. Velocis keeps crying out Linnie's name. Buster moves to intercept, leaping to clip her wings with her greatsword.]

[She nearly lands the hit, but, blindly, Kryl'ya Kontsa swings out behind and catches her attack. The voice of the greatsword cries, *"My lady, watch your back!"* As sparks fly and the blades seem locked together in midair, Hazel grins maliciously.]

>>[!quote|author] Hazel
>Oh, queen. Linnie's been knocked off the board. And Ildy's out of play, too. To play this game, you've got to know the rules. Our move's done. Nothing's changing it now. Make your move before we skip your t--!

[Velocis turns only her head.]

>>[!quote|author] Velocis
>“Today, you have chosen obliteration. So be it...”

[She seethes and everyone in the arena seems to hear it and shrink back in their seats. Buster's face suddenly drops, mouth agape. The queen's filled with bloodlust, same as her. Velocis twirls, knocks Buster's blade away, and uses her action to attack 5 times: she swings at Buster five times with Wings of the End. She lands every single strike, carving a star symbol into her body. The queen's doing a lot of work, and even destroys her head again and cuts off one of her arms (again). On the fifth swing, red, snake-like energy bursts out from Hazel's [[Cloak of Excelsio|cape]] as it catches unholy fire, and the head regrows immediately. Wings of the End suddenly stops, inches in, before it has a chance to cleave Buster in two from the waist.]

>>[!quote|author] Hazel
NO REGRETS, BITCH! LETS SEE HOW FAR YOU FLY WITH THOSE WINGS OF YOURS! *TY BUDESH' GORET'!*^[(You will burn!)] 

[Hazel's eyes are glowing pink. In the middle of Kryl'ya Kontsa's subsequent swing at her waist again, she punts the blade aside with one leg, grabs the queen with her remaining arm, who immediately pauses in disbelief, and dropkicks her with the other leg a far distance, breaking the top barrier of Einon Stadium with the impact. The crowd audibly gasps in disbelief. The King turns in panic, and Succotash grabs his hand and flies up and out, leaving a rainbow trail, as they move to pursue.]

[Hazel's arm grows back, but she's breathing heavy. She glances up. The beam slowly fades, sending rubble crashing to the earth below. The prince is out of sight, and you don't know if or when you'll see him again. Dinofang sits embedded in the dirt below, glinting, next to the star-topped wand that represents the legendary remainder of Ildy the Eidolon. The duo are not here any longer, both taken from you within minutes of the other. Buster cracks a smile again. Her job's done here… everything else is theatrics now.]

## The Final Speech

>Now, then! Nothing to jog your memory like fighting a grieving mother...
>
>Before we get to the big show, I'd like to give a round of applause for our silent, [[Illarion Parasom|anonymous corporate sponsors]], and [[Heartknock|everyone from here]] who contributed to that showing. And of course a great big thanks to our tech crew, whom you can see looming above you all. I'm sure you'll get to know my good friends real soon at bladepoint. It'll be a date. Thank you for making this shit possible! It's been real fun, and it's about to get so much better.
>
>Oh, and for what the queen just did, I'll say you guys can go ahead and take your revenge. I'd say, a thousand lives per hit she got on me. Don't count the brat's hits. For those of you not counting, that's 6,000 people of Drastic dead and burned. 
>
>Or, y'know, fuck it! Count the brat's hits if you like. Make it a real bloody mess! And if you run into trouble, bail out with said brat, of course. I'll see you fucks at home, either way! *Dosvidaniya!*

[The nine silhouettes suddenly take off, leaving streaks of black smoke across the sky as they fly to various places in the city. The ships break off as well, casting shadows over the city. You begin to hear the sounds of destruction.]

>Oh, of course. I'd also like to give a special thanks to the [[Kingdle Coal|two]] [[Kingdle Fire|lovely]] folks who can't be here right now whose chaos has certainly bloomed in full tonight. We were hoping for perfect attendance, but, y'know. You've got shit to do. Hope these festivities don't lead to a number of incidental casualties on your end… Eh, fuck 'em!
>
>Now! Once again, I'm gonna need the crowd to listen the FUCK UP.
>
>For everyone not interested in seeing their property turned to ash and their lives wasted… you've got a head start in leaving the arena and saving something before my compatriots and soldiers blow it the fuck up. For everyone else… get comfortable. Death hurts like a fuckin' waspsting.
>
>Unless we've got any volunteers willing to die to me… *Let the game of war begin!*
