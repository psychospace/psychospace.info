**Anti**, the **Ignition Point**, is the progenitor of the [[Divinity|pantheon]], the authorship of the [[Divine Equation]], the architect of [[The Planet]], and speaker of the [[Golden Voice]].

It is the foundational "genetic" origin figure of all deities in modern worship. Strictly speaking, Anti's portfolio is beginnings. They are the purported parent of [[Athemat]].

# History

In the [[Old world]], [[The Maker]] fused with [[The Unmaker]]: two halves that were at war with one another for incoherent, lost reasons. When this being, of both creation and destruction, departed this land into [[Chartless Sea|Chartless Sea]] whence it came, Anti was its [[Echo]] which remained in the world.

Eventually, Anti took over [[Kibangan]], carving out [[Welkin]] from it.
