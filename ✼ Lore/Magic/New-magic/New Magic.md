**New magic**^[Styling of this term varies: sometimes it is hyphenated.] is the term given to a roughly-categorical systemic change to the functions of [[Psychospace|psychospace]] which fully began to assert themselves after [[Zero Day]] in [[1251 PT]]. The term also refers to study of this change; **new magician** or [[Psion|psion]] are common terms given to students of the craft.

It is categorically different from current understandings of "book [[Magic|magic]]" that existed before it and exists alongside it.

>"*They* call it new. But it's only ‘new’ if you haven't been paying attention. It’s only ‘new’ to people like the scanners, only ‘new’ because now they got a name for the movement. Only ‘new’, cuz the ‘old’ has decided it has a problem with it."

Derived from indistinct entities or systemic alterations, such as [[The Signal|the signal]], new magic scrapes the potential of the [[divinity]], and is thus on a baseline more uncontrolled and wild than usual magic. Specifically, there is a requirement that some level of [[reality-bending]] without the necessity of [[Spell|spells]] occurs under its use. 

A propensity for new magic can be born into people. Creations only possible with this less-controlled magic include [[Antique#False antiques|false antiques]] and advanced [[enchantment|enchantments]].

Despite the name, many significantly older studies of magic less clear on form, such as [[witchcraft]], fall under the exact definitions created by new magic. 
# History

Although it had existed as a tangential belief in the arcane community for about a century prior, it wasn't until the end of the [[Dragonic War]] that the public would come to comprehend the depths to the changes in Magic occurring on untold scales. [[Omen|Omens]] of the change were born throughout the world, many without knowing it.

Its origin appears to be undetermined, though many hypotheses exist, such as the [[sky-scrape]] or the [[End Times]].

# Views
[[Illarion Parasom]] held the belief that the change would bring reality to a breaking point. Some share this view.

As its proliferation can be said to threaten the world [[Fulcrum|on a global scale]] (and potentially has provably [[Collapse state|ended it]]), many governments have seen fit to limit its legal uses and sequester the science away, though births exhibiting the abilities of new magic continue to occur regardless of any efforts to contain it.

The [[Coven of the Night]] and the [[Numberless Children]] are two prolific groups which have offered their support to new magicians.
