![[⎋ Needs Expansion| clean]]
**Elain Valaransia** was a sorcereress wood [[Elf]] allied with the [[Nortian Conspiracy|Conspiracy]], and member of [[Special Task Force Undergarden|STFU]]. 

During the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]], she was killed by a friendly firebomb after reviving [[Darter Orsana]]. When this firebomb struck her, the phoenix seed she kept so close bloomed, and she became enraptured by the tree and grew alongside the party's [[S4t|Beatific Keep]].

Like all of the Conspirators, Elain normally wore the [[Cloak of Excelsio]].

She wielded the [[Phoenix Seed]], an arcane focus capable of reviving her and her allies.
