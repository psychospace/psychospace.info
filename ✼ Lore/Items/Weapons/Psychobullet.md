The **psychobullet** is a peculiar novel weapon for slaying [[Figment|figments]], effectively the "last word in [[antimagic]]". Put another way, its purpose is to collect [[Echo|psychic data]] when it kills a creature of mental creation. It was originally created by [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] during their control by the [[Nortian Conspiracy]].

This bullet, crafted out of thousand-night [[Hepatizon]], is an ineffable force which stands against psychospace's very existence, forged of lastward metal. It is incredibly difficult to make. An attack using a psychobullet will pierce any manner of defenses which rely on psychospace, and will instantly destroy many figments.

Against an invulnerable target, it simply ends the effect granting invincibility without dealing its damage. In addition, a target that has its invincibility broken instantly takes two points of exhaustion.

Even on a miss, the psychobullet is rended with a single use. As it flies through the air, it creates a clean line through psychospace that can be seen as a sort of shattered glass window effect. After about 12 hours, this is no longer apparent, but is still faintly visible.

>>*Magic ammunition, legendary*
>>
>>This bullet deals lastward damage, meaning any creatures who have effects that regenerate their health automatically at the start of their turn cannot use those traits until this bullet is removed from their body by a powerful medic (or a *lesser restoration* spell).
>>
>>Compelled to extinguish souls, a psychobullet attack can never have disadvantage, except from its user's exhaustion. If a psychobullet attack gains advantage from 3 or more effects, no roll takes place: the bullet simply hits its target instantaneously.
>>
>>On hit on a figment or psychic form of a creature, most things are unable to alter the target's defenses from their most basic, vulnerable forms.
>>
>> An antimagic field cannot cancel this item, since that stands against psychospace's existence much the same as this does. However, dispelling effects of 6th-level or higher are able to turn this bullet into a non-magic lastward bullet.
>> 
>> To detect magic, this item gives off *divination* magic.
