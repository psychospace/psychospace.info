Master **Drachedion Balthazar** is a [[Sorcery|sorcerer]] [[kobold]], a savant of fire magic. An ex-member of [[Critical Hit]] who now operates a very popular estate where he studies and teaches magic. Lord Mayor of [[Lond Point]].

Balthazar is the result of a combination of red and gold blood, granting him early mastery over fire and a distinctive shining-orange scale-tone. However, it is also the source of his largely infamous personality, often behaving high and mighty even when at a knowledge deficit.

As a part of Critical Hit, he operated in [[Pyrrika]]'s place for a while after a fall damaged her leg beyond repair. "Zar" was a revered master of magic for many years after these adventures before retiring quietly to a manor on the Glass Coast called [[Puzzledam]]. One of the later additions to Critical Hit, he is ailing and quite old nowadays, although he researches a way to "undo fire" and potentially lengthen his life.

Though born with two wings, he was well known across the continent for his trademark of having lost one. With his genius, he has constructed a means of replacing the wing. He has a hobby of playing the piano.

Him and Ikabod are... tentatively pen pals.

Balthazar was born in [[1184 PT]], making him 66 as of the [[Dragonic War]].
