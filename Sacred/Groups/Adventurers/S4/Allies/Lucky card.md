![[âŽ‹ Gameplay]]

This item functions identically to a *seeker dart.* It is a golden playing card, an ace of spades with gilded fringe and a wicked sharp steel edge. Even without its magic, it is known for being a signature weapon of the legendary [[Ashton Orpheus Albatros|Ace of Gold]].

When you whisper the word "seek" and hurl this card, it seeks out a target of your choice within 120 feet of you. You must have seen the target before, but you don't need to see it now. If the target isn't within range or if there is no clear path to it, the card falls to the ground, its magic spent and wasted. Otherwise, elemental winds guide the card instantly through the air to the target. The card can pass though openings as narrow as 1 inch wide and the cracks between doors, and can change direction to fly around corners.



When the card reaches its target, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and 3d4 lightning damage. The card's magic is then spent, and it becomes an ordinary card (although it retains the ability to be used as a dart).
