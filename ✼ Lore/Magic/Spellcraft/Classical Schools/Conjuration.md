**Conjuration** is the [[magic]] study of **conjurers**, and is one of the eight [[Classical Schools]] of magic, interlinked with [[abjuration]]. Conjuration is the study of the forces of existence -- such as [[chaos]] -- the means by which these forces interlink with [[psychospace]], and ways they can be pulled forth miraculously to operate on your behalf. 

The broadest of the Classical Schools, comprising about a fifth of the entire [[hexicon]], the study of conjuration covers the broad topics of creation and transmission, such as [[Portal|teleportation]] and [[summoning]]. There is a broad theme of "maintaining" spells. Many [[Spell|spells]] which deal with the [[Soul|soul]] and the souls of others are cited as conjurations, such as the finding of [[Familiar|familiars]]. Conjuration further works to shape the forces of [[elemental energy]] or the [[Out There]] to one's will, enabling one to create attacks out of [[fire]] or [[water]]. Of spells seen "in the wild" from non-sapient sources, none see more use than conjuration.

At the fundamentals of conjuration is a fascination with [[psionics]], in particular the [[Phoreus field|phoreus fields]] that are produced by forces inside and out of the realm of the mind. Like with its interlinked study, conjuration is rarely a subtle art.
