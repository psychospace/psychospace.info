The *[[Vipernest-class]]* **Dom Otdykha**, the **Holiday Home**, is the forward operational airbase of the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], floating in the [[Mer de Vide]]. It is an [[Airship]] supercarrier forged in [[Umazia]] in [[1248 PT]], originally for the purposes of research in various regions. When it was used during the [[Dragonic War]], it was customized with a larger bay for ships, to accomodate steelclad warships, as well as a larger brig and storage section.

# Appearance

It barely resembles any typical aerial machine, yet through clouds, its appearance is coldly implicative.

Comprised of three massive pyramid-like structures, their points facing downward and all joined together to form an imposing arrow pointed north, the base looks more like a completely manmade remnant than an airship. The base is supported from the top by three massive propellors and monitored by smaller scanning vessels, and the base also has additional thrust points where it appears to have sails keeping it in place. 

With windows and railings all along the outside of the strange spiked structure, the building would not be out of place in one's wildest imaginations. Lining the outer edge of the massive base are anti-airship cannons, capable of ripping a vessel apart at close range.

From the inside corner of the triangular assembly, there exists a large multi-faceted dock — the largest entry point — and at the top of the central structure, a large, triangular bridge from which the ship must be commanded. To offer a scale, this vessel easily appears to be the length 100 times that of the [[Red Diamond]], and easily fifty times the width.
