An **Outsider** or **Old One**^[Also sometimes called a **Great One** or **Great Old One**.] is an eldritch influence of the infinity of the [[Out There]]. Told of in [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] literature, Outsiders are widely held to govern the void regions between [[Manifold Seas|manifold seas]], and are usually not to be trusted.

Though their existences are almost entirely theoretical, the Old Ones apparently harbor impeccable and ineffable power, beyond the reach or ken of the [[Divinity|divines]].

Because their existences are incongruent with the [[Context|contexts]] created by [[Logic]], contact with one of these beings requires special consideration, though more myths than can be counted speak of the risks of doing so. 

# Influence on [[The Planet]]

It is assumed^[By those who affirm that the [[Calamity of the Eyes]] took place.] that the gods of [[The Heavens|The Heavens]] sought any excuse to avoid working with the Outsiders, despite what is believed to be mutual goals and incentives. Some still sire [[Witchcraft|witches]] to this day, despite this awkward animosity.

According to legend, Outsiders helped to produce the [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]], and so many of the more absurd effects of lynchpin devices can likely be tied back to the Out There as their source. One is supposedly the source of (or itself *is*) [[the Signal]].
