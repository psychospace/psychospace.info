The **Väräh**^[(*VAH-rah*)] is the axiomatic [[Elemental energy|elemental]] **plane of [[metal]]**, a cryptic layer of the planar stack, placed in between the [[Scarlet Skies]] and [[The Below]]: [[fire]] and [[earth]], its two components. 

# Properties
Like each of the other elemental planes, it has its own inhabitants, and its influence being returned to the realm has produced changes to reality. As a part of [[the Fortress]], it was a component of the [[First City]].

According to research done by House Parasom, it is, supposedly, the place from which the [[The Signal|Signal]] first contacted our reality.

# Etymology

Its name is an ancient [[Infernal]] phrase which means "vibration". Its demonym is "Värähnian".

# History

Though it has apparently existed since [[The Gathering|the Gathering]], at some point it subducted into [[the Fortress]]. 

It has only re-emerged recently along with [[Umbraid]], following [[Zero Day]].

Early expeditions to the unveiled realm revealed that [[noemite]] was abundant in the crust of most Värähnian [[Remnant|remnants]], leading to the improved development of [[Verlan]].
