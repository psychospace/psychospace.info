**Fourth to Kalends of Sabela, 1250 PT**

Lord [[Drachedion Balthazar|Balthazar]],

Firstly, I would like to express my apology for our previous talks. You were correct. The fourth and sixth arcane sigils were a slight bit off the mark in terms of iteration and loops, and the points along them did not align with the suppositions and composition of the fragment, as shoddily emulated as my interpretations of it are nowadays. I have become obsessive, and thus have begun to overlook even the simplest truths we hold over the Equation. It is some habit I need to break. Once I adjusted that, the flow of [[Vis]] was perfected, and [[Mana]] gathered on the fringes and took shape to my will once again. For that recommendation, I thank you again, dear friend.

Secondly, I admit that in some giddy excitement I announce to you that I have achieved a particular landmark of mine with the completion of this project. It is as if I am a child all over again, making breakthroughs and feeling as if nothing could ever stop me. The [[spell]], for all our troubles, finally worked late last night. It took quite a toll on me and my materials, and the watchful eye of my assistant throughout many a failed test and restless night. But at last, I have replicated a lifeform from word and relic. 

With such a monumental success, many paths in research lie open to me, and I admit I am a bit dizzied as to which I shall take in stride next. Although this marks a fantastic turning point here, I must also confess that a precaution had to be taken, and thus I reach out to you for aid once more. But, as I'm sure you do not open letters to give voice to the grievances of your old friends, let us start with the reticent benefits of such a process.

The creature I have replicated is a humanoid, a feminine figure with angelic wings, but not like those of [[Velocis Dino|Her Celestial Highness]]: this girl has more protean, ancient wings than the wings of an [[aasimar]]. She seems that of an ancient [[elf]] of some kind, which [[Flora Neeld]]'s notes describe in [[Shindani]] as an “[[evangel]]”, an evolutionary stepping stone between mortal and [[Celestial]], borne of the period where the [[First Magicians]] went wild in their attempts to explore their new bounds. The subject seems incapable of inherently speaking a language, ancient or modern, but it is likely that she shall mature to learn language in some form. Perhaps sign language, as [[Trobairitz|my assistant]] learned? It remains too early to tell her capacity for knowledge.

In addition, her nature as an ancient [[creature]] leads me to two conclusions. First, that there is much we misunderstand about the capabilities and powers of ancient magic and creatures: even in the short time I have known her, the [[visitant]], as I have codified her type, seems incapable of outright or accidental destruction, capable of sustaining a fallen chandelier. Second, I believe that other fossilized creatures might be recreated in a similar fashion for research: gifting a husk a false soul and using [[Vibe]] to do it. I believe that the peoples of [[Dawndust]] are well aware of the implements of [[resurrection]], and now I have at my fingertips a much more ancient derivative to that power in the arcane dealings of the Equation. It is henceforth unknown the outright limits of surrogation, and I itch to try it more. 

I name this creature a visitant for its soul's nature. Visitant is an archaic term for a ghost or other specter, and perhaps it shall soon come to mean this sort: a visitation of the stuff of [[psychospace]] and the extants of another living thing to craft a full and total creature. It is as if creating a bear cub from nothing physical but a bit of fur. The potential of this, needless to say, boggles the mind.

Again from Flora's notes and translations, it appeared that this person (which I have now reanimated) was an ally to the Old Duer of ancient Archipel, at least aboard the vessel her bones were found in. They said her rosy eyes could see a “debt” on each she looked upon, and so to the Duer, she was known as “Skuld”, their word for “certain future”. I have taken to calling her [[Certain (evangel)|Certain]] for now.

This spell required injections and appropriations of Vibe and Light in all its forms, which is perhaps how I have managed to craft it in such a fashion. The wishes of the past, alive again. I can hardly believe it is happening in today's day and age, let alone by my guiding hand. Can you think of what the [[Somber Troupe of Arcane Research|Somber Troupe]]'s old members might say if they saw this now? ^86b4a9

However, even with all the excesses and successes of this initial process, I must now come to you with a slight bit of bad news.

The spell, even in its pinnacle form, failed to properly recreate Certain the first time. The slush took shape, the materials gleamed and burst, and yet the [[body]] slumbered still, a soul barely stirring in her cold corpse. It was only with the mark of lifeblind that I gave her a brain and mind she could walk around with. I understand that [[lifeblinding]] is not advisable, even among advanced magicians, but the research had gotten me this far, and I knew that those bound by the mark to the marked have enhanced regenerative properties, especially magically. I was incurious of the immediate side effects, so I accept this tax as assurance that my work thus far wasn't for naught. 

The deviations from simulacra are undeniable, as are those from homunculi and clones, however I was hoping for a less serious side effect than nothing occuring at all… Mayhap I am drifting too far one way or the other? But this would mean a complete restart of the spell's composition, which I am unwilling to accept as a potential at the moment.

As I've unraveled thus far, this mark upon my flesh, bound to her existence, assures her age does not accelerate due to the conditions we found her component parts (her bones) in, but it also binds my life to hers, forcing my age to evaporate at a rate of two days per single day that passes. I admit I am keenly aware of your retort ahead of time, and I am in complete agreement. This is entirely inadvisable as a long-term strategy, especially if research is to continue. But, there exists no inherent flaws in the spell, so why does it craft a creature that does not wake? 

Perhaps even Dawndust knows the futility of my efforts. Perhaps I am a fool for getting this far. A fool on the hill. I feel so ever distant from the people of this town, and this mark I bear is now a penitence I pay for it.

I have decided to, in the wake of this discovery, name the spell [[Ikabod's surrogate soul]], and I have hastily copied down notes of this spell which are in transit to you separately by courier. Of course, as previously discussed, it is of sixth-level [[arcane complexity]]. I pray you give me aid here. 

You talked to me some time ago of the ability to “undo fire”, in reference to the ability to extend life or perhaps reverse the literal aging process. Is this still an inquiry of yours? Have you uncovered this potential? I understand your ruminations take time, and Certain's sudden existence now provides me a subject with which I can tinker for some time to seek future understandings of the world. However, I struggle to not consider the [[death]] that might await me should you never return this message. 

Thank you once again for your aid, master Balthazar.

Yours,

**Ikabod Caruso <br>of [[Rainbow Ridge]]**
