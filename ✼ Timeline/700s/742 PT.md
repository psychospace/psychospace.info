[[741 PT]] < here > [[743 PT]]

The [[Carapa Republic]] is attacked by Great Bandit King [[Plesio Falknjir]] and is overrun. Within the year, the Republic is overthrown and the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] is mostly established as a civil authority.

The night before the [[Drastic|Holy Port of Ace]] is attacked, a meteor shower appears over the Starcrater, giving Plesio's troops the resolve needed for a successful assault.

[[Aso ar'Carapa]] is killed, [[Curse|cursing]] the new royal line with the [[Dragonic Curse]].
