This page acts as a [[✼ Index|hub]] for the (in-universe) chronology of [[The Heavens]] and the [[universe]] which surrounds it.

![[Worldline#^a586f7]]

1. **[[Old world]]** 
	* _Unknown historical length._
	* The old world becomes a utopia, all peoples uniting under a single will.
	* The [[Chartless Sea]] is discovered.
	* **[[War of Chaos]]** 
		* _The old world begins to be destroyed._
		* The universe's stability is permanently threatened by [[Chaos]].
		* [[The Maker]] emerges to attempt to correct the danger the universe is in, partly by destroying and remaking it.
		* [[The Unmaker]] emerges out of the resistance against the Maker's apparent destruction, and is mistaken for the Maker.
		* The war ends in an apparent stalemate as the universe is consumed. 
2. Destruction of the old universe
	* The old world is gone, and only [[The Planet|The Planet]] and the [[Echo|echoes]] of the past remain. 
	* The fused Maker and Unmaker are otherwise alone in the broken universe.
	* All that remains is Chaos, [[Logic|fate]], and [[Gravity|gravity]].[^roots]
3. [[Unknown Era]]
	* Following this, the moons orbit the planet. 
	* The [[Out There]] cradles the [[Antic Sea]].
4. BPT 1,000,000 to 500,000 — **[[Age of the Gods]]** according to the mythology of the [[Pantheon of Dawndust]].
	* [[Anti]] emerges, the “husk” left behind by the fused Maker.
		* Its [[Golden Voice]] speaks the [[Divine Equation]] into existence, reintroducing untold billions of concepts to the universe.
		* [[Dragon|Dragons]] are born from the “rediscovery” of the Planet.
	* [[Kibangan]] is discovered; Anti carves out [[Welkin]] from it as a throne of influence.[^wbis]
	* BPT 950,000 — A new divinity emerges from Anti's influence.
		* [[Athemat]], the first [[angel|angel]], and [[Cien|the star]]'s manifestation, [[Cientia]], create [[Arizhmiya|Lagacia]] and [[Exponen]].[^golorr]
			* Cientia is made divine: [[Time]] returns to the world.
			* Athemat is made divine: causing [[Psychospace|Psychospace]] to emerge.
			* The fire of Lagacia's body creates [[Lex]], [[Ordo]], and [[Melotte]].
			* Lagacia's “ending” is robbed when it is made immortal: just so, Exponen's beginning is robbed by its transitory, imaginary state.
			* [[The Above]] and [[Cien]] beyond it emerge to watch over [[time]].
		* [[Remnant|Remnants]] of the old world float amidst everything.
	* Lagacia shunts its old self and becomes **Arizhmiya** to bring about an ending to itself.
		* At the same time, Exponen's identity takes shape as the god of the future, and its manifestation, **Nexos**, creates [[Unwri]].
	* The [[Scarlet Skies]] and [[The Abyss]] emerge.
		* The [[Blood War]] begins.
	* BPT 800,000 — The last major god initially manifests.
	* BPT 550,000 — The [[First Magicians|First Ones]] emerge, using [[magic|magic]] in its modern form.
	* The [[Folly of the Twins]] occurs, causing the moons to become divine embodiments and creating [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[goblin|goblins]], and [[Harengon|harengon]].
5. BPT 525,000 — **[[The Gathering]]** begins.
	* [[Whill|Whills]] emerge powerful enough to raise themselves to [[Mortal God Ritual|godhood]], altering psychospace.
	* BPT 510,000 — The divinity is threatened by this chaos, and create the planar stack to prevent collusion.

		* To further reinforce their rules, the [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpins]] are created with help from Outer beings.
	* BPT 500,000 — Arizhmiya [[Breaking of Sacred|attacks Sacred]] with two [[Blackflame|blackflame]] comets, causing [[Mount Celestia]] to erupt and kill many thousands of angels, as well as shatter the remnant in half.
		* The Age of the Gods comes to a close as Arizhmiya is shackled by Eriva, removed from the divine roster. The past, subsequently, falls into obscurity.
6. Post BPT 500,000 to 50,000 — The **Age of Primordia**
	- The First Ones archaeologically vanish: their immediate descendants, [[human|humans]] and [[Elf|elves]], are first attested.
	* Immortal influence, especially direct divine influence, is reduced to individual instances.
		* [[Scion|Scions]] emerge as mortality and immortality are combined.

		* At last, mortal civilization is allowed to thrive.
7. BPT 50,000 to present — The **Age of Mortals**.
	* Most remnants have their most ancient societies at the start of this epoch.
	* [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]] is born, able to transcend its lifespan and the universe with mere thought. Delivered a [[Amakudari's phantom|Promise]] that it would abandon either the planet or its ability, it returned to the planet and founded [[Ith'Paraan]], a civilization which constructed [[Void Breaker|void breakers]].[^loa]
	* [[BPT 12147]] — The [[Os'Grun]] meteor hits [[Bullion]], rending and destroying most magically-dependent technology that existed at the time.
