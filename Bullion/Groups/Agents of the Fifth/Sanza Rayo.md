[[Saint]] **Sanza Ewald Rayo** is a [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qauli]] [[Alect Keeper]] of the [[Fifth Institute]], specifically the Keeper of [[Eudico Fenske]]. Known as the "Saint of Light", Sanza Rayo is a [[Broadcaster]], and probably the most famous one known to be allied with the [[The Shibboleth|Shibboleth]]. He is well-known for the suit of armor he is always pictured wearing.

Rayo began his tenure with the Institute as a Special Adjunct, as "[[Songbird]] 583", thanks to powers that rendered him apparently near-immortal. As of [[1285 PT]], he is around 24 years old, easily the youngest Alect Keeper, though he looks even younger for reasons unknown.

# History
Not much is known by the public of his past for certain. According to Rayo, he is a [[human]], and was born in [[1261 PT]] in the town of [[Urick]]. Around the time he was ten, the town of Urick was attacked by a caster going [[OTR]], and everyone except for those who had recently been with Sanza vanished.

When he was 12, his unusual state of affairs rose to national attention when he appeared to cure someone suffering of the earliest [[taphrine]] plague. Due to this, soon as he had turned 14, he was offered Special Adjunct status at the Institute, though mysteriously, his light was incapable of being used to synthesize a chemical cure to taphrine. Regardless, he offered alms and religious services to those suffering the plague, which many cited as the reason they survived it. He rose to sainthood thanks to this dedication.

He now acts as a vanguard advocating for the control and understanding of new-magic, as well as ways in which it might be utilized for the betterment of society.

# Abilities
When he was born, his abilities caused him to become blinded, though at the same time restored his sight through a kind of photoperception: able to see via reflections of light he casts.

## Codec: Lamella
Rayo's [[Codec]] is known as **Lamella**, an antiquated biological term for plates, such as those used in armor. He possess the ability to unconsciously translate the Signal through reflections, in particular from his skin, into luminous energy that evokes holy, purifying properties.  Apparently, the Saint can see wherever his light is being used through his photoreception.

His light is capable of reversing some of the influence of [[Reality-Bending|reality-bends]], similar to an [[Ehrgeiz]]. *Rayon energy*, also called **lamellan light**, can act as armor against reality-bending in general, thanks to this fact. 

He can produce this energy essentially at will, though doing so leaves him lethargic incredibly quickly, and so prefers to prevent it for the most part using a full-body suit of armor constructed for him by Institute armorer [[Meir Rayner]]. 

In addition to its uses as pure armor, Rayon energy can also be used for attacks, though in limited contexts. According to a potentially true legend, the Saint once [[Exorcism|exorcised]] a [[Surge]] instantly by removing his mask in front of it.

### Sophistry
The archetypical [[Sophist]], lamellan light can be shared with others and transported through trapping it in objects similar to that of an [[ambrotype]], as his bands of energy apparently move at ittyonic speeds compared to true light. Many of the Institute's agents have been equipped with clothing or armor that traps Rayon energy to use as a second-skin and potential countermeasure against new-magic threats. 

Through testing, it was discovered that in this more distilled form, his light can also reveal potential for [[Bias coagulation#Antibias|antibias]] in an observer, and so many [[chirologist|chirologists]] bear tools that contain fragments of lamellan light.
