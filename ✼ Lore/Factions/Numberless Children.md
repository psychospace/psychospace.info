The **Numberless Children** (NLC) is a decentralized faction sympathetic to [[new magic]]. Across [[the Heavens]], the NLC is seen as the oldest organized faction of its kind. 

Their members, sometimes called **Nulks**, protest against demeaning and degrading treatment of [[Psion|psions]] the world over, spreading literature of hope and salvation, and advocating for changes and escape from neophobic polities and policies. 


# Ideology
Though its subfactions and individual members [differ and debate](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality) on what exactly its true goals are as they evolve over time, a modern Nulk generally advocates for [egalitarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism) treatment of new magic and those naturally talented with it, especially compared to [[Magic|old magic]].

The NLC were founded as an unbound collective with the aim to universally enable the free practice, mutual understanding, and potential for hope that new magic can bring to the disempowered, seeking emancipation and equal treatment for psion culture. 

Most Nulks are not [anarchists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism) or psion [supremacists](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacism); some of the most vocal historic members have approached such rhetoric, and the group is often characterized broadly as these.

They see allies in groups like the [[Coven of the Night]], who advocate for similar practice.

# History

The NLC first emerged in late [[1256 PT]] in response to a controversial policy upheld by [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qauli]] authorities, which consigned practicing psions to unequal treatment as, by default, necessarily [[Reclamation (Bullion)|reclaimers]], due to the danger they posed society, forcing many into hiding. With the NLC's protests, neophobia gradually turned to anxiety about the inexplicable events and tragedies which Nulks were seen as abetting.

Even when this policy was revoked by the Golden Council and ones like it were revoked across the [[Mer de Vide]], the social standing of psions broadly struggled to recover. Throughout the [[taphrine]] plague's peak, new magic was further demonized as a cause for the deaths sweeping the skyseas.

Throughout the years new magic has been a part of the reality of the Heavens, the NLC has been influential in preserving psionic civil rights, and have been occasionally recognized officially by various governments (both for good and ill). In more recent years, NLC have splintered into several schools of thought, some of which are in social conflict with one another, and the term "Nulk" has become synonymous with neophilic sentiment or publications, even those whose philosophies do not necessarily align with the NLC.

# Etymology
The NLC's name arose from the practice of "numbering" psions, even children, catalogued under initial policies concerning reality-bending: this assigned each caster a unique number, often tattooed onto them, in order to prevent further crime. Nulk sociologists have stated that this clinical practice was an effort to reduce the psions' autonomy and personhood, in hopes that the practice of new magic would be criminalized altogether.  As such, a "numberless child" is someone who had escaped such a process, living free from oppression; the NLC hope to bring this numberless life to all psions.
