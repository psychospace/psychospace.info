The Islet of **Tralas** is a minor [[remnant]] off the coast of [[Bullion]], within the [[Wabi Steppe]]. Politically, the land falls under the [[Wabi Isletary Concordat]], and is tautologically considered second in that number, between [[Izani]] and [[Mangamma]]. 

Named for [[Tralas Falwaekian]], the islet has, for all recorded history following the [[Os'Grun]] impact, held peculiar [[Magic#Latent|latent magical]] properties, hence its identification with a legendary [[Witchcraft|witch]]. 

The [[Kuroki Almanac]] calls it the **Islet of Nascent Stars**.
