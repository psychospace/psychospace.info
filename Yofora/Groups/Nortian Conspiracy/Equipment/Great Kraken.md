The *Great Kraken* was a [[Batnest-class]] armored warship, her premiere example, acting as the flagship for Division 9 of [[NIMROD]], under the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], during the [[Dragonic War]]. 

It was modified to carry an even greater number of weapons than it was capable of beforehand by the Secret Weapons & Air Ordinance Research/Design (SWORD) Bureau. The *Kraken* is a one of a kind juggernaut of a ship.
