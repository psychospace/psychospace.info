**Barbiche** is a [[satyr]] village upon the side of the mountain in [[Low Sacred]] known as [[Snowcrown Mountain]]. As of [[1251 PT]], its leader was [[Rasage]]. It is well known for the mythology of the Champion of [[Sekkan-shin]].

The town oh-so-familiar to Kessah, comprised of mostly stone and straw housing, some built with dirt into the side of the mountain itself as it slopes down along the western edge of the settlement. It spans quite a few acres but is surrounded by tall trees on all sides. A cave can be seen at about the center avenue of the village built out of a channel that flows throughout. Only a few individuals, each with braided hair, and can be seen running back and forth between workstations, and a chill has noticeably set in the air here.

Centuries ago, during the reign of the [[Carapa Republic]], in the time where Low Sacred was unconquered and [[Sylva]] still oversaw the activities at [[Atlan]], the village of **Byaraba** was subject to much scrutiny from the [[Unitor|Unitors]] at the base of the mountain who feared the satyrs. Unrest between the two races soon unfurled and the satyrs found themselves outnumbered and outmatched by the [[Evangel|evangels]] who wielded more advanced weapons and technology the satyrs lacked. 

One young satyr sought the help of [[Sekkan-shin|a silver dragon]] who resided at the very top of the mountain, asking for aid against the humans. In return, the satyr and his descendants would act as the silver dragon's champions should it find a need for one. The satyr returned to his village, newly bestowed with a small portion of the dragon's magical essence, and he used the power to scare off the humans and end the conflict, a savior for his people.

The satyrs have since gone further into the forest, their society hidden from the humans and their existence becoming a fairytale within the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. Only one Satyr within the savior's bloodline is born with the innate magic given by the dragon at one time. The dragon itself has been dormant for decades, but still the village honors it's aid with treasures and gifts every year.

The village makes their own mead out of lavender infused honey, which is a local delicacy.
 
The satyrs of Barbiche usually have 2 names. The one they are born with, and the one they are given, or in some cases chose for themselves, once they find their place within the village. Babies are given a name ending in a vowel, either written or by sound. It is a name representative of their youth and adolescence. Once a young Satyr has found their purpose or contributed greatly within the village, they are given a new name. Some families have different traditions on how the new name gets chosen.
