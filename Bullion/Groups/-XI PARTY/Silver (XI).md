**Silver** is a [[Human]] rogue. 

# History
Like the rest of the party, she was apparently revived by [[The Pitcher]] in the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]] on the Ides of Vire, [[1249 PT]]. She claims that she did not actually die, but was instead had her soul sucked into a magical artifact upon accidentally touching it. 

Not much else is known about her past.

She eventually pursued the bounty offered up by the [[Daily Grind]].

# Personality
Silver is very proper in everything she does. She carries herself with purpose and professional vanity, like a business executive approaching an important meeting. Her posture is perfect as she moves and her gate seems trained to have consistent, quiet footfalls. 

She almost always carries a perfectly neutral facial expression and stares uncannily at the person she is speaking to.
