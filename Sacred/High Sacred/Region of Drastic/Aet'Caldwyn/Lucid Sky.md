![[âŽ‹ Needs Rewrite]]
One of the last lines of defense the angels constructed to protect the [[Blackflame]] are a pair of golems. Originally commissioned by [[Aso ar'Carapa]].

Coursing Stream: Similar to its ally, Splitter is a humanoid golem with massive wings, constructed as the controller of the blank city's defenses in general. Splitter's wings are made of a glittering gold and blue powerful water current, like the sky at sundown, as the embodiment of the [[Grand Watersea]] itself. Though originally tasked with finding a way to snuff out the blackflame, when this did not work, they offered their strength to keep it sealed away.

Lucid Cry: Bearing an ascended halo and designed in concert with the giant forge in [[Mount Celestia]], the humanoid golem's green glass wings, almost like a dragonfly's, were constructed to offer immense protection to the forebearer, as well as an efficient gliding swim in case it would be necessary. Its [[Celestial language|celestial]] name is best translated as "Tricky", and it can be considered a kind of nephilim, bearing traits of both [[giant]] and angelic ingenuity. In the eons that have passed since anyone has offered it a challenge, Tricky's uranium glass wings have shattered a hundred thousand times, though the psychic field they use to throw away would be absconders still maintains a phantom form of their old self.

Tricky uses a short range cannon which can clip the wings of any determined attacker, while Splitter primarily uses sermons in forgotten tongue.
