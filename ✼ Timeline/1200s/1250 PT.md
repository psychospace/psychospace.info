###  4-30-1250
[[Chance Seria]] makes one final notice before consuming the [[Mutagen of Absolute Self|Spiraling Dance to Eternity]] in the Cavern of Loot. As a result of the drink, Chance vanishes from existence, and [[Buttons and Snooze]] suddenly appear nearby.

## Unfata (5)

[[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] empress [[Bianca Nortia]] uses her ascendant [[Monism]] to commune with [[Uforia]], believing that she will need the guidance.

### 6-16-1250
Bianca's soul is apparently unreachable: her [[body]] has been possessed by [[Scarla Nitrum]], who coerces [[Amanita Parasom|Amanita]] and [[Octavia Parasom]] to work for her by claiming that their stepmother was taken captive. In the panic, [[Illarion Parasom]] assumes emergency powers using [[Project KC]] as a pretense, and uses the [[Prime Doppelguard]] to act in her place. [[Serena Nortia|Serena]], Bianca's daughter, is unaware of this. The Doppelguard control Bianca's image by the afternoon, and she assures everyone that nothing is the matter.

## Sabela (7)
### 7-10-1250
[[Junah Rollingstone]] is at last freed from the machinations of [[Dawndust]]'s [[Flipside]], [[Pandemonium]]. This was a great triumph of the Sacred Military and the [[Dawndust]] Listener Corps working in tandem, and the year was annointed this title by the King Tyranno upon return of the troops. Junah aged seven years in the only two year interim and has remained on the nearby remnant of [[Bullion]] since the mission, still in recovery from the events.

### 7-29-1250
Ikabod re-creates the [[Evangel]] "[[Certain (evangel)|Certain]]" from notes taken from an [[Archipel|Archipelian]] warship, binding her to his soul with the power of the [[Lifeblinding|Mark of Lifeblind]]. He records this success in his journal.

## Neun (9)
### 9-21-1250
[[Serena Nortia]] attempts again to use [[monism]] to communicate with her mother [[Bianca Nortia]], but finds her soul is unreachable.

## Zanneter (10)
### 10-5-1250
[[Arthur Graywell]] celebrates his 55th birthday.

### 10-21-1250 
While conducting a domestic investigation south of [[Burun]], [[Serena Nortia]] discovers a facility constructing strange magical items, and a message meant for her tucked in a book from the [[Sovereign's Tower]]. After using [[monism]] on her mother, this realization allows her to find that her mother is apparently unresponsive and locked away: something is very wrong.

## Annaher (11)
### 11-1-1250 
Serena departs for Sacred to investigate the project, believing her life is in danger.

### 11-9-1250
Diviners learn of an oncoming [[ghost storm|strange storm]] about to hit the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. The same day, six monks go missing in mid-teleport. King [[Tyranno Re Ursus]] is alerted.

### 11-10-1250 
In [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]], three other monks, who had yet to get the message about the [[Ghost storm|purple storm]], vanish mid-teleport. A message is passed around that travel via magic is dangerous without a physical medium.

### 11-12-1250 
[[Summer Sundress]] instructs [[Shohei Integra]], who is feeling anxious having stayed for so long within the city of [[Drastic]], to test the mettle of a new recruit, [[Theresa Leighton]], for the membership of [[The Fold]].

### 11-13-1250
[[Tyranno Re Ursus]] announces to the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] that there is to be a temporary ban and strong warning against using teleportation, due to a [[ghost storm|mysterious weather phenomenon]] passing near to the remnant that has seemingly resulted in the sudden loss of a few monks who use teleportation circles to make their way around. 

[[Shohei Integra|Sho]] says farewell to his family and proceeds to take [[Theresa Leighton]] to the test location.

### 11-14-1250
Prince [[Lazuli Dino]], attended by [[Ildy]], [[Lylian Burgitsk]], and 16 [[Burgitsk Houseguard]], begins a trek to [[Rainbow Ridge]].

### 11-18-1250
Prince [[Lazuli Dino|Linnie]]'s convoy is caught in a mysterious [[Ghost storm|purple storm]]. At the end of the night, only 4 of the 16 guards are left accounted for. The Prince was protected by the Shield of Purity cast by [[Ildy]], whilst [[Lylian Burgitsk|Lylian]] was protected by her [[Celestial]] nature and oath. Afterwards, the storm lingers in the Graveland, and many people evacuate. 

On the same night, nearby, [[Shohei Integra]] and [[Theresa Leighton|Tessa]] are also caught in the storm and witness a [[Phantasma Goria|mysterious figure]]. Sho isn't seen again for a while.

### 11-19-1250
Tessa emerges from the [[Ghost storm]] and is displaced to [[Drastic]], atop the [[Saurus Castle|Kingtower]]. She is detained by the [[Dino Airstyle]] and interrogated. After they realize she was subject to a consequence of the purple storm, she is set to return to [[Lond Point]].

### 11-25-1250
Prince [[Lazuli Dino|Linnie]]'s convoy finally arrives in [[Rainbow Ridge]]. [[Lylian Burgitsk]], within Rainbow Ridge, sends word back to her mother that she is safe, and elects to head north to [[Puzzledam]] on her own, hoping that Balthazar will have some means of protecting her until the storm passes. 

On the first day, Prince Linnie meets with [[Ikabod Caruso]] and continues to meet him daily for the remainder of his trip. Ikabod instructs him his plan for curing the prince's curse, but ensures that the process is secret.

### 11-26-1250 
Prince [[Lazuli Dino|Linnie]] consents to have his soul [[clone|cloned]], and Ikabod does so, creating "[[SUEANNIL]]". Ikabod then uses [[Ikabod's surrogate soul]] to retrieve Sue's soul and place it within a [[heart container]] in the middle of his lab. With their heart wrested from them, Sue returns to water.

### 11-27-1250 
The prince's soul, wholly cloned as a heart container, is initially fragmented. Using [[Vibe]] as a filler and bodies of ice and slush to give them a place to inhabit, as a test, Ikabod creates [[Lyrica|No.1]], comprised of the prince's sense of authority. He also attempts to restore Sue to life, but fails.

### 11-28-1250
Using similar methods, Ikabod creates [[Lithop|No.2]] and [[Lacuna|No.3]], both comprised of the prince's caring aspects. These souls seem to be far too happy to withhold the dangerous curse.

### 11-29-1250
Using similar methods, Ikabod creates [[Lethal|No.4]] and [[Lucent|No.5]], both comprised of the prince's tricky aspects. These souls seem closer to what he is aiming for, but do not have any rage within them, only conniving tactics.

### 11-30-1250 
Using similar methods, Ikabod successfully creates No.6, christened [[Locket]], comprised of the prince's creative aspects. Unexpectedly, this is at last successful in withholding a piece of the dark illusionary magic that have the curse within them. 

As a failsafe, and to keep bits and pieces of the heart container so they can restore to full later (without needing the Prince's presence), [[Pendant]] is created as a clone of Locket. Knowing these are likely his most successful creations thus far, he [[Lifeblinding|binds his soul]] to each of them, granting them a will instantaneously while the others slumber and slowly "gather their thoughts" in his lab.

## Gewalt  (12)
### 12-1-1250 
A [[rainbow of transport]] containing a missive from the king reaches Prince Linnie, instructing him to recruit adventurers and go the long way around back to the capitol due to the oddities of the purple storm, as well as investigate and calm some people of [[Low Sacred]], who reportedly were hit hard by the storm's effects. 

On the same day, [[Ikabod Caruso]] offers [[Pendant]] to the [[Dwarf#Duergar|duergar]] of the [[Otell Sanctum]] so that Pendant can be experimented on by them, hopefully uncovering some secret that yet eludes him.

### 12-2-1250
In a break in the storm, [[Arthur Graywell]] departs [[Drastic]] for [[Rainbow Ridge]], curious as to the prince's intentions with the quest as well as seeking an excuse to have a bit of a vacation. 

Having been snared by the storm, [[Shohei Integra]] suddenly pops back into existence near Rainbow Ridge, his [[soul]] damaged. [[Serena Nortia|Serena]], following a passage in the Aeolian [[Apocrypha of Winds]], discovers and repairs him as a guardian angel using [[Monism]].

The tabaxi [[Open-Skies Free Bird|Bird]], feeling happy after finishing his trip to Rainbow Ridge, gathers his things, and just so happens to take a poster for the Prince's quest before proceeding back to [[the Whiskerwood]] by caravan.

### 12-5-1250 
[[Open-Skies Free Bird|Bird]] returns to [[the Whiskerwood]]. In the meanwhile, [[Serratura Neeman|Serratura]] and [[Chiave Neeman|Chiave]] have already decided to adventure out to investigate why nearby [[Phantasm|phantasms]] are failing. Bird gives the two a poster telling them to head north to Rainbow Ridge to join the prince's entourage, and they prepare and move out that evening.

### 12-9-1250
[[Serratura Neeman|Serratura]] and [[Chiave Neeman|Chiave]] arrive in [[Rainbow Ridge]], and witness the prince returning from a tower up north: Ikabod's [[Maline Tower|tower]]. 

Ikabod's ruse, tricking them into experimenting for him, is caught onto by the [[Dwarf#Duergar|duergar]] scout Dilan. A small band of two duergar siege his tower in the night to rob him of more slaves, but [[Trobairitz|Santo]] eliminates them with the [[Broom of stars]].

### 12-11-1250 
*[[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]]* begins on the doorstep of the [[Maline Tower]] in [[Rainbow Ridge]]. Arthur Graywell, Shohei Integra, Chiave and Serratura Neeman, and Eldral Levin accept the call to action put forth by Ikabod Caruso, traveling to the [[Otell Sanctum]] to rescue [[Pendant]] in exchange for renown and a good word put in with Prince [[Lazuli Dino]], whom Ikabod has been helping these past weeks.

### 12-12-1250
The adventuring party rescues Pendant from the Sanctum deep within the [[Rainbow Caverns]], slaying the duergar mind master. While sieging the Sanctum, the party spotted a mysterious figure named [[Phys]], wearing a [[Shiny Mask]], who teleported away, swearing revenge on Ikabod. Pendant is returned to Ikabod.

### 12-13-1250
The Ides of Gewalt arrives, as does the prince's test to recruit an escort group.

[[Ikabod Caruso]] is attacked by [[Phys]] using a massive mecha, and the party stops the mecha; [[Trobairitz|Santo]] flees his tower for good. Impressed by their bravery, Prince Linnaeus recruits Arthur, Serra, Sho, Chiave, and El as his [[S4|escort group]]. The escort group sets out from Rainbow Ridge, traveling through the night along the [[Sienn Byway]].

### 12-14-1250 
Linnie's escort party, traveling through the night, arrives in [[Ladybug]] in the morning. Through some slight detective work, and through a game put forth by a triton named [[Hikawera]], the party successfully eliminates a venomous troll terrorizing the city which apparently teleported under that city. The party stays the night in town, in an inn called the Twist Ending.

### 12-15-1250
The party travels into the Precipice Plains, spotting a few strange things, and camps out in a strange outpost near a cave (coming across [[Chance Seria]]'s final note). That night, [[Star of the North]] falls from the deck of the [[Aerkastelo]], escaping the clutches of sky pirates. Star is recruited to the party.

### 12-16-1250
The party travels into the region known as the [[Giant Forest]]. They traverse this area into the town of [[Cherryheart]], and prevent the Aerkastelo from crashing down onto it. Wishing to heal the ailing [[Heart of the Woods]], they travel into [[the Beastlands]] to find its counterpart, the Tree of Time. They rest in Chiave and Serratura's childhood home in [[The Whiskerwood]].

### 12-17-1250
The party travels from the Whiskerwood to the [[Tree of Time]], eliminating a band of goons wearing shiny masks, sparing a number of them and coming into contact with [[Kingdle Coal]], their apparent superior. Coal teleports away, leaving the band of goons a failure. This band of goons is seemingly just one of a larger cult known as the School of Heartknock. Each of the ones the party spared were actually pirates who had hijacked the Aerkastelo. 

After eliminating the threat and destroying the Dark Brainframe corrupting psychospace, the party leaves the Beastlands, leaving Chiave to complete his training as a druid. After leaving the pirates in the Prison of Slabs and successfully atoning the Heart, restoring its true nature, a new [[eidolon]] is born to defend Cherryheart, named [[Nist]]. A plan is devised to search for a captain for the [[Aerkastelo]], to escort the ship back home to [[Archipel]] upon their duty's end. The party then camp in the desert.

### 12-18-1250
After a chance meeting with a strange formless cleric named [[Enoch Starfell|E.T. Starfell]], the party arrives in [[Midzone]], and to best assure the safety of the prince going forward, recruit the disguise expert [[Alexios Hawthorne]] at the gates. While shopping at the [[Bazaar of Fools]], the group runs into “Santo”, who has now taken the name [[Trobairitz]]. 

In their reunion with the party, the party crosses paths with Starfell's lost journal, retrieving it and discovering a wealth of knowledge on the remnant of [[Yofora]] and the monsters and mechanisms which dot its landscape. The party resolves to return it to Dr. Starfell, and stay the night in the Looking Glass Inn.

### 12-19-1250 
Serratura catnaps a bag of tricks, while Arthur pores over the journal. That evening, the [[Bazaar of Fools]] is attacked by [[Heartknock]]: while most of them self-destruct, [[Magnet (tiefling)|a tiefling]] remains dead, and could provide intel on the School. After preserving the body with the help of the local guard, the party stays another night in the [[Looking Glass Inn]].

### 12-20-1250
The party, in some haste to resurrect the tiefling, leaves Midzone with a new mount in tow, named [[Betelgeuse]]. The party traverses [[Beastmaw Canyon]], before resting in an old fort.

### 12-21-1250
The party, continuing to rush, leaves the canyon, resting in the desert.

### 12-22-1250
The party travels through and rests in [[Monument Yard]].

### 12-23-1250
The party rests near the stronghold of [[Krydda]].

### 12-24-1250
The party arrives in [[Gateway]], meeting Buttons and Snooze at the gates (who join the escort group as they desire to go to Drastic for assistance with their blood curse). The tiefling [[Magnet (tiefling)|Magnet]] is revived at [[Destiny Cathedral]] and reveals that the School of Heartknock recruits from those who harbor anxieties against the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. That night, at the [[Clear Skies Pub]], the prince reveals his own cursed nature to Star to secure her confidence.
### 12-25-1250
The party, searching for a captain for the [[Aerkastelo]], have a second meeting with [[Hikawera]] in [[The Money Pit]]. Afterwards, the party continues on to [[Wisfer]], arriving late.

### 12-26-1250
The party embarks upon [[Logan Caruso]]'s [[Logan's Bastion|Bastion]] in search of magical knowledge. Afterwards, the party continues on towards [[Hope Springs]], and rapidly deals with a plant issue. The party stays the night in the coastal town.

### 12-27-1250
The party travels up the Bandit's Road towards Drastic, and camp in a roadside forest.

### 12-28-1250
The party continues towards Drastic at breakneck pace, passing through the Starcrater Mines. That night, the party, camping on a cliff, dreams of strange images.

### 12-29-1250 
The escort group finally completes their goal. At midday, the party arrive at [[The Well]], and are greeted by [[Vyctry]], Dora Maxwell, [[Cefal]], and [[Hieron Dredge]]. Meeting with the Queen, the party is awarded the [[Sacred Royal Ultra|Royal Ultra]]'s badge, the [[Nova Star]], as well as the Beatific Keep and the cash prize.

### 12-30-1250
After a night of fixing up the keep, the party holds court with Eldral's sister: [[Isadora Ilacqua|Isadora]], and [[Windriders|her party]]. During the lunch, they realize that Buttons and Snooze have gone missing on their own for a cure. Hunting them down, the party finds a number of clues that lead them into a shaky alliance with another someone searching for a missing person by the name of [[Ruby Reno]]. However, at the end of the day, they are apparently gassed and pass out.

## [[Augenschein]]
### First of Augenschein
The party awakens, having been kidnapped by a noble family in the Well who does trafficking. The [[Ashton Orpheus Albatros|Ace of Gold]] frees them, but due to the alchemy they'd been plied with (as well as trauma in the days to come), the party's memories of the subsequent events are shaky. What is known is that Ace gave Serratura a mystery key, Buttons and Snooze were rescued and kept safe, and the family was brought to justice by Vyctry, the vindictive eidolon of the Well.

### Second of Augenschein 
The prince and Star train together in the afternoon. The final preparations for the Summit are made. Ikabod arrives in Drastic with all the visitants, intending to bring his findings before the crown after the Summit. Elsewhere, Volk begins a mission to the Grandglass Plains. Elsewhere still, Kessah gets immensely drunk at a party in Pendulum, and is arrested for disorderly conduct for the night.

### Third of Augenschein
![[Red Spark#Events| no-h]]

### Fourth of Augenschein
That morning, the party is “tested” by a strange entity known as [[Serena Nortia|Nadezhda Naroda]]: with a well-placed lightning smite, they are repelled (and appear to be Shohei). The Red Diamond continues on towards [[Waxtown]], and the party meets [[Volk Vendleberg]], a royal executioner, who is hunting down someone who abandoned his post immediately prior to the Summit, as though he knew it was coming. The party finds him in [[Waxcutter Library]], and chases him down into an underground bridge-base where the local [[Spider's Web]] administrator, none other than Arthur's brother [[Igor Ingolstadt|Igor]], is waiting for them. The party attacks and kills Igor, though his body is stolen through a portal. The party also recruits someone who looks exactly like the prince, [[Lethal]], who was just recruited into the Web and wants to know why he can't remember anything. The party rests up at Volk's home, [[Castle Xilan]]. Elsewhere, Kessah and Sekkan survey the damages done to Drastic before departing for Waxtown.

### Fifth of Augenschein 
That evening, the group attends a formal party for the New Year's held by fearful nobility at [[Sharkbite Bluff]]. There, they meet up with [[The Runts]] again, and also meet Kessah and her silver [[Dragon]] patron [[Sekkan-shin]]. Sekkan-shin tasks the party with, to stop yet another war, “reuniting” the legendary members of [[Critical Hit]]. Serratura takes a strange cat home to Castle Xilan.
