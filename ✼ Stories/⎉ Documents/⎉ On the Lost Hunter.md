*Text found inside [[Logan's Bastion]], in two scrolls marked with a skull, by the [[S4|Royal Escort Group]]. It was assumedly written by [[Logan Caruso]].*

“A week prior, I had encountered a mischievous sect of warriors somewhere within the [[Giant Forest]] as I sought a natural solution for my lacking materials. A poisonous stench on their breaths, I thought at once I might need to dirty my hands to get away. But they claimed they worshipped some kind of old entity, a ‘[[Lavastus|Lost Hunter]]' who once brought peace to this land, and requested I pray to this entity before I discussed with them any further. 

"As I lay there, hands aclasp, my hypotheses started to form. My deductions lie in the past of this remnant, when the [[Carapa Republic]] attempted many works here, as the heretic groups then called Unitors. Perhaps this group was founded by a deserter of the Unitors who stood with the beastmen and natural-born lords of [[Low Sacred]], and that deserter descended into legend as a martyr for this sect? I could not say: alas, this remains outside my inquiries into the underbelly of the world. 

"These people say they were searching too, for something in tune with nature. They said, their quest was for old ingredients, old recipes, things lost to time when the Kingdom had what they wanted with their land and settled freely; in particular, they sought some potion that would aid in reinvention and reanimation. I asked how might I help, and they said that I might want to traverse their difficult trials first, if I was not going to simply fund their nomadism. At once, they brought a goblet before me, filled with some bubbling incomprehensible substance. 

"My fears got the better of me and I turned away. I struggle now to get the stench of it off my tongue. I thanked these warriors for their interest in me, though I did so without indulging the liquid, understanding that they must have each taken this tincture to accelerate some abilities of theirs. I paid their medic for a curio that lied in his possession, said to be a ‘fragment of a [[soul]]' which might be used curatively. Perhaps I might use this fragment to repetitively use as a soul vestige? I could not say, but they bid me farewell afore I could ask them more.

“Imbued with that soul vestige from the warrior band, it became far easier for me to rapidly craft new digger skeletons with wildly different physiologies, mixing parts and merging bones together. The roadblock, I see now, was assuming that a work of my sorts would always be able to adapt to a new form using its own memories. By merging soul memories and vestiges together, it becomes far more easy to craft stronger skeletons without fear of ‘rejection' in transplantation. For the moment, I progress speedily. I only hope that the resulting combination does not then return twice the rebellious force, or that it does not tie the creations to the Unknowable.”
