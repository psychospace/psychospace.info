The **Maline Tower** is a tower overlooking Dragonfly Lake in [[Rainbow Ridge]]. Previously owned by the [[Theresa Leighton|Maline family]], and grown notorious from its use by the criminal wizard [[Tenora Yegim]], it was eventually made use of by [[Ikabod Caruso]] and used as his laboratory and home for around a decade prior to the [[Dragonic War]].

Equipped with [[lux]] infrastructure, Ikabod's time in the tower allowed him to clean up the property and make something to be proud of. He put much of his paraphernalia here, including commemorations of his time with [[Flora Neeld]], as an ally of [[Critical Hit]], and as a member of the [[Somber Troupe of Arcane Research]].

The tower is comprised of 5 rooms on the ground floor, 7 rooms on the first floor, and 4 rooms acting as storage on the two following floors. There is also an additional storage shed, off to the side, and two basement floors that were dug out long ago (both of those have 4 rooms and a simple hall which connects them).
