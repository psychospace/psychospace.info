**House Dino** is a noble house, the royal house of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] for many generations, since the fall of the reign of the Falknjir line. They originated with the Paraves line.

Their [[house words]] are often shortened to simply “*Repent and Set Fire*.” Many grave markers throughout Sacred are marked *R+SF* in honor of this.
