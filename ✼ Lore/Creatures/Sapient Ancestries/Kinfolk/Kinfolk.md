**Kinfolk**, or **kin**, is a general umbrella term for [[fey]]-adjacent heritages of #sapient [[Creature|creatures]], who resemble non-sapient animals, insects, or other creatures to a significant degree.

Due to the pervasiveness of both [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]] and [[psychospace]], natural energy often finds itself twisted with the flow of [[Soul|souls]] and perception. Before [[The Gathering]], the power of magic was enough to transmute and create distinctive humanoid ancestries out of these individually revived [[Echo|echoes]] of [[Old world|previously-existing]] creatures.

Kinfolk communities are often ancient in origin, and find solidarity with one another.
