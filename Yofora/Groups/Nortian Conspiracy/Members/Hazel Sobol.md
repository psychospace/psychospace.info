Captain-Buster **Hazel Kurovna Sobol**, also known by her peculiar title *Champion Serena*, is the [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] [[Bianca Nortia|empress]]' chosen knightess, a [[Dullahan]].

A self-proclaimed hero of her people, she was second-in-command of the [[Nortian Conspiracy]] during the events of the [[Dragonic War]].  She was notable for having personally orchestrated the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]], and was the mortal enemy of the [[S4]].
# History 
Prior to [[1229 PT]], even as a squire, Hazel showed promise and fervor for the empire. Coming from a long line of knights and knightesses who served the [[Conductors of Court]] as bodyguards, she was fueled to her station by the war stories of the [[War of the Masters]]. 

She eventually caught sight of [[Serena Nortia]], and, immaculately infatuated with the [[Successor (Nortia)|successor]], trained extremely hard in order to impress her and seduce her. At first, when they both were teenagers, this was playful, but quickly Hazel realized how seriously she wanted to be a part of the aasimar's world. Serena rarely acted anything but distant when concerning things like love outside her family, but Hazel continued pursuing her anyway, in hopes that when Serena chose someone to marry, it would be her. 

Knowing she needed a new way to the top, she wanted to continue pursuing the enemies of the empire. She decided in [[1230 PT]] to become a dullahan to eternally serve the empress, in hopes that, one day, Serena might marry her. However, after Hazel had become a dullahan, Serena was already engaged to [[Maria Simetryevna|a lady-in-waiting]] instead.

## Post-undeath
As a dullahan, she no longer physically aged, leaving her face stuck as she was when she was 21. In this duty, she became the empress's personal guardian, otherwise policing the streets of [[New Orc City]], and being deployed away from home only when necessary.

In [[1250 PT]], she was eventually coerced personally by [[Illarion Parasom]] to join the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], believing it was the empress's will. As part of this war, what she always hoped to prove herself in, she was regularly repaired by [[Wren Doggabone|the Wrench]], who often recognizes she goes too far. She was also gifted with the [[Betwixt Blade]].

Following the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]], where she was killed by the S4, she continued to pursue them on multiple occasions. From [[Dom Otdykha]], the base of operations of the Conspiracy, she helped orchestrate their offensives on [[Low Sacred]]. Though she believed herself in control, she was really being manipulated by the Lord of Law. She also was to assist in the [[Miraclesfield Experiment]] by testing LT-bombs, but was pickpocketed and killed before this effort could be made.

Following the events at [[Aet'Caldwyn]], she was rapidly deployed to intercept the leaving *[[Kymodokê]]*, in hopes of recapturing Serena. However, Serena, naturally, was able to make her talk, and reveal the Lord of Law's role in the Conspiracy: an act which resulted in her being manually torn home.

Hazel was sequestered for quite some time after this, and was absent for much of the S4's mission to Nortia.
# Personality
The reciprocal mindset of a dullahan's vengeance-fueled nature caused a feedback loop where Hazel constantly refuses to realize Serena's changed state, and thus continues fighting. Such a dedicated, if delusional soldier is a great weapon for an empire to wield, certainly. If someone lies to her and say that Serena said it, she would follow the commands.

If she is ever in danger of being coerced against the Nortian empire, she has had a bomb implanted in her by the [[Nail of Nortia]], known as her "leash". She can detonate it on her own, or she can have it detonated remotely, which causes her to be sent home to be reconstructed.

By virtue of her dark contract, Hazel carries out her empress' orders to the letter. Indeed, this means she has taken on infinite poisons, injuries, and curses in her line of work of endless sin. This marks her with the perhaps peculiar title of the "Champion Serena", seeking out each [[curse]] to take it unto herself and shoulder the burden, even (or perhaps *especially*) if it would kill her.

Depending on the job, she equips herself with other weapons and tools, as a master of many fighting styles and disciplines.
# Appearance
She stands enormously tall and hulking in her onyx black armor, specifically molded to her very flesh, for as a dullahan, she cannot ever remove it. Her muscle mass and body size greatly exceeds natural limitations. The armor is often dripping with pink blood, constantly oozing her neck socket unless it is whipped up into pink fire or used to suspend her own head by magic, her long red hair flowing back behind her.

The curses flow through her like blood, and has turned her own veins pink with defilement.

Like all of the Conspirators, Hazel wears the [[Cloak of Excelsio]].
