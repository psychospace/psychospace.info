A **contiguator**^[con-tig-you-ay-tor] is an [[Magic|arcane]] machine which acts as a recycler in an automagic network. The machine funnels unused transversal material, such as [[lux]], and transforms it back into [[Vibe]], its source form, preventing [[stagnation]].

This disperses its energy and prevents the local environment from building up impurity in the form of [[Light (property)|Darkness]]. Contiguators are necessary parts of lux infrastructure, playing a vital role in preventing outbreaks that can ruin an entire laboratory.

The contiguator was invented in the [[10th century PT]] as a means of converting [[mana]] into other forms.
