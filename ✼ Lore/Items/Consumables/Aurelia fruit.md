***Aurelia*** is the name given to a specific fruit tree. The fruit of an *aurelia* tree is capable of curing any disease, even those which are borne of the blood.

The seed of an *aurelia* fruit is capable of healing one's most grievous injuries, as if by *greater restoration*. Like the *[[Wish]]* spell and many other reality-altering skills, the fruit attempts to adjust as little as possible to cure the ailment.

Nobody knows if it truly exists or is a mere legend.
