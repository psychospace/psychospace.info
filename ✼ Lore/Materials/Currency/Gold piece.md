A **gold piece** is a widely recognized currency throughout [[The Heavens]]. Different civilizations mint different types of coin, though these are usually pinned to the value of gold as a material. One gold piece can be split into ten [[Silver piece|silver pieces]], and ten gold pieces make up a [[platinum piece|platinum piece]].

Weight-wise, a common [[Kingdom of Sacred]] gold piece weighs about 9.5 grams, so 115 gold pieces is about a kilogram.

Gold was standardized as a currency when [[alchemy]] reached its first major breakthrough. In that study, it is important to understand the value of components. Gold had a remarkably stable alchemical weight of 100 *[[hathun]]* per centigram of gold, a standard which preserved into [[Tribute|tribute costs]] when spells became more standardized, and so the material came to be valued by [[Wizardry|wizards]] and then by everyone else.

Artisans who aren't necessarily skilled in their craft generally expect a daily wage of 1gp. For a laborer, it is generally the product of two week's work.
