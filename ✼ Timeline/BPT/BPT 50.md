**BPT 50** is a [[Year (unit)|year]] in [[Pinwheel Tempo]]. 

# Events
## Origin of airships
So a myth goes, the elves of the [[Gray Waters]], located at a concentrating point of life energy, were besieged by a [[Dragon]]. When this dragon perished, its egg was fetched from its hoard and submerged in the Waters to prevent its soul from rousing. 

Several days later, [[Core engine|cores]] emerged on the surface of the Gray Waters, manifestations of the dragon's past lifetimes, silent but clearly in accord with the locals. The elves, who culturally associated rebirth with natural power, venerated the cores as sources of glory, and used their energy to craft a number of magical tools. 

Eventually, a priestess resolved to take one of these cores home with her as a holy artifact. When it was taken aboard a ship sailing down the river, the vessel sprouted wings, creating the first [[Airship]].

## Initiation of the Purge
Many of the dragons of [[Dawndust]] at the time were hunted or sacrificed (in what is now called the [[Scaled Purge]]) to be transmogrified.
