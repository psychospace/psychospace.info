A **deathlock** is a type of [[undead]] spawned when a body of a [[Witchcraft|warlock]] returns to life with a fragment of its [[patron]] (typically an advanced [[Gift (witchcraft)|Gift]]) still inside them, essentially severing parts of an entity and stranding them on [[the Planet]].

Deathlocks have emerged in all kinds of scenarios, and fear of them has bred fear of the witches which may give rise to them. They are typically revived by this fragment in order to fulfill a goal left unfulfilled in life, or simply to gain more power.

Deathlocks are immensely powerful whenever they arise, but are impressively rare, as patrons rarely place so much trust in creatures so much more fragile than themselves. Some believe that [[Amad'Oroa]] was one, explaining its pseudononymous nature and power to create works of art that act as [[Lynchpin device|lynchpins]].
