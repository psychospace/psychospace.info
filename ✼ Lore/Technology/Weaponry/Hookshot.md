An unconventional weapon, the **hookshot** is a type of projectile weapon originated by the lassos and whips used by the [[Wildwalker]] tradition of [[Bullion]], essentially creating a launcher which can fire a grapple point. 

It fires a projectile that connects back to the weapon with a chain. On a hit, the weapon rapidly winds, pulling the user towards the target point. There are many configurations of this weapon, but the most common is a large pointed tool that digs into a surface, and forces the user's arm to point towards the target, like a pulley system.

>>The hookshot has a range of 50/100, and deals 1d12 piercing damage on a hit. It requires no ammunition, but can't fire if the hook isn't retracted.
>>
>>The hookshot can attack only once a turn. On a hit, the user is pulled towards whatever the hookshot's target was provided it dug in, stopping within 5 feet for a creature or stopping on or within 5 feet of a targeted surface. If the character reaches the hookshot's target, the hook retracts automatically. In most scenarios, the user will often take incidental damage from landings and momentum. This counts as "damage from a fall" for the purposes of circumventing it with items or features.

>>If the hook can't dig into the target, or it extends to its full range without striking a surface or target, the hook returns to the weapon. If the hook bounces off of something, it makes a prominent noise.

>>To detect magic, this item gives off *evocation* magic.
