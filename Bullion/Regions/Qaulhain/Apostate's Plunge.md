**Apostate's Plunge** is a notable canyon in the [[Emirate of Qaulhain]]. It is approximately 500 km (310.7 mi) long, and deep enough that it forms a cross-section of [[Bullion]]. Parts of it are known to be [[Phantasm|phantasms]] that lead to [[Tarnation]].

Said to have been first created by the [[Mortal God Ritual]] of the [[Adder King]], the Plunge became notable as the place where the Golden City was initially constructed, near modern-day [[Ingot City]].
