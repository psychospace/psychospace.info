In the earliest years of the remnant known today as [[High Sacred]], before [[Pinwheel]] began to count time, many humans who came to the remnant by wing of ancient beast did not choose to live under the protection of the [[Evangel|evangels]] who came to rise in power in the remnant with their magic, believing more in the natural elements, their dragons and their steeds, as altogether a pantheon of reality. 

In other words, in each and every [[bird]] there was a piece of a bird god, in every horse a piece of a horse god, in every human a piece of a human god, et cetera. This belief system came to be generalized as the **Impendium of the Sleepy Yore**, a religion comprised of faith in dreams, magic, nature, and astrology, and are said to have inspired the conqueror [[Plesio Falknjir]]'s affinity for astrology and may yet have given Sacred its very symbol.

The people who believed wholeheartedly in the Impendium, in naturalistic coexistence with higher forces and indefinite gifts, came to have faith in the importance of dreams and wishes in an everyday existence, especially when survival was key, in order to pass down from parent to child the "Worldream", an esoteric set of natural instincts and pursuits which they believed were nurtured from the time of primal Sleep Gods to be passed down in every living thing. This formed societal roots in the core of their belief system, for the better passage of the dream, as was their holy task in life to do.
  
[[Somnia]] and its people are one such group who pass down the tradition of the Sleepy Yore to this day.
