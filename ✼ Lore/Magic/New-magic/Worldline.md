In [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]] studies, a "**worldline**" is the [[Epitome|epitome]] of the very [[The Heavens|Heavens]] themselves, though sometimes the definition expands to include other planetoids or sometimes the breadth of all of [[Manifold Seas|manifold space]]. It describes the change of the world through [[time]] *and* space, rather than concerning the timeline of a singular piece of it. 

The worldline described on this wiki is, without otherwise specifying, describing the events of the primary worldline (which hasn't [[End Times|ended]], yet, to my knowledge). **Alternate** worldlines are also described, such as [[Elseworld]]. 

Without a worldline, there would be nothing distinguishing this [[The Planet|Planet]] from the [[Out There|Out There]] that cradles it. In other words, nothing which came from here would be able to perceive or continue as normal. A [[Collapse state|collapse state]] is the common term.

# Nature

Viewed from a top-down perspective, a worldline is called such because it does not, per se, describe a 1-dimensional structure, but an endless chain of interlocking states (known as [[Context|contexts]]) which work together and follow alongside one another to bring about an experience of reality.

All actions, natural laws, and [[Logic|logical]] continuations of cause-and-effect continuously permeate and alter the worldline on a scale too incredibly intricate to measure or quantify. Instead, [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturges]] often simply concern themselves with "bigger-picture" effects to the worldline, such as major [[Reality-Bending|reality-bends]], or tendencies of the worldline, the same fatal structures interpreted by [[Divination|diviners]].

## Transcendence
While an infinitely-many worldlines are said to be "parallel" with our own, or reasonably equivalent, this restricts view of potentiality to only what has occurred, and only what must occur. Through contact with a possibility-field, such as a [[Gift (witchcraft)]], your perspective might expand, but also begin to view contradictory elements.

Entities have been known to observe or travel to worldlines where they do not exist, transforming them into worldlines where they do exist — or vice-versa (*universe travel*). They also or retreat or advance along the tight rails they exist upon (*time travel*). Either case is exceedingly rare and significantly difficult.
