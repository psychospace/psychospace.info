[[Arahabaki|Umisachi]] eradicates thirteen villages with one bolt of lightning each, sparing only the leaders to speak of it, gathering energy from the fear it inflicts. This earns it the title of "the God's Error", [[Arahabaki]]. This catches the attention of [[Mount Celestia]], who place it under execution using an [[Angel]]'s arrow. When its body cannot be slain, it is eradicated and [[Stygian]] is constructed to contain its fragmented corpse.
