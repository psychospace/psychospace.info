An [[Archipel|Archipelian]] ship similar to the *[[Magnificent-class]]*, the ***Superbia*-class** [[Airship]] holds a small crew intended for use as a cargo vessel, with space for arms and modifications should the need arise. Its cargo bay is roomy and makes a good place to keep heavy, live cargo, such as mounts or warbeasts.
