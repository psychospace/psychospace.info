**Valerian**, later called **Valerian Nortia** and mythologically known as **Valerian Uforia**, was a demigod who was the first [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] emperor (in legend). He was the first material creation of [[Uforia]], and is thus sometimes given the epithet “Eldestborn”. 

He emerged possessing the dragon’s own identity and abilities: essentially a vessel Uforia could use to explore the world. As a result, he had unparalleled psionic talents, which, without care, could bind thousands in a hivemind, eradicating their free will. 

As a member of the [[Temple of the Uforiad|Uforiad]], he is called “Dream of Wanderlust”. 
# History
As the story goes, a young man was said to have been created from Uforia's forehead over the course of a 2 month [[dream]] that covered an estimated 12,000 years of mental meditation. 

However, Valerian lacked a [[Fylgja|fylgja]]. Because of the nature of his creation, and without a spirit to guide him, Valerian lived many hundreds of years (believed to be from around 8000 BPT to around 7400 BPT) almost wholly unbound by the yoke of the gods, a factor that caused other’s destinies to draw to his lack of one, like a [[Logic#Guidance of logic|black hole]]. 

This “gravity” led to other creations of the Uforiad, such as the [[Cradling Hand]] and the [[Dustwall]]. 

Eventually, his lack of a *fylgja* was alleviated by his return to his maker and subsequent union with [[Ekaitz]], which gave him dominion over storm but reduced him to mortal status. After this resulted in Valerian’s demise, the first historically confirmed empress, Valerian’s only daughter and powerful warrior [[Svetlana Nortia]], is attested to have ascended to her father’s station.
