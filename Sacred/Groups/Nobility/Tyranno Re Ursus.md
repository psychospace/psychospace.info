King-consort **Tyranno Re Ursus** is king-consort of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], notably during the [[Dragonic War]].

A human of 57, Tyranno Ursus was the duke of the region of [[Drastic]] for many a year, gaining that title after his father retired. During his time as duke, Tyranno felt that the political structures of Sacred were threatened by the [[Age of Adventurers|rise of adventurers]], and thus acquired a sour reputation after that move was proven to have been unforeseeably inept. Tyranno married Queen [[Velocis Dino]] in [[1220 PT]], becoming king.

He was father to [[Linnaeus Dino]].
