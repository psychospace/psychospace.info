The **Prime Doppelguard** is a counter-espionage ring for the [[Great Nortian Empire]] staffed by [[Doppelganger|doppelgangers]], in this universe changelings whose will to self-actualize was denied, allowing them to be puppeted easily.

It is divided into three "flags": First, which primarily patrol the streets in secret; Second, which are exclusively defensive of the empress and her immediate hierarchy; and Third, which are exclusively deployed to foreign countries in secret.

[[Phys]] deserted the Prime Doppelguard before his training was complete. [[XO]] never joined the Doppelguard, living underground most his life, but when threatened with the potential of being forced into their service, he took the alternative option.
