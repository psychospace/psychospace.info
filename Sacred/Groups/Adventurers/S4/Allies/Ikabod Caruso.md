**Ikabod Laila Caruso** is a half-high-[[Elf#Half-elf|elven]] magic researcher of some repute. Master of both the art of [[Wizardry]] and [[bladesong]], his connection to many figures in history helped to supplant his position.



# History

Ikabod grew up a boy outside of [[Drastic]] in the small hamlet of [[Emerald Haunt]]. His father was an outspoken critic of the country's long time spent within the [[War of the Masters]] for its own interests. 

When Ikabod was quite young, his mother was identified as acting fully against the kingdom, and his family moved back to the capital when forced to sell their property. Ikabod eventually received tutelage at the [[Constellar School]].

As a bard as part of the [[Somber Troupe of Arcane Research]], Ikabod trained under many a master but was always intrigued with his own goals. Interested less in spinning his own stories and more in the grand tales of the mythical [[Trayan]] and his [[Tower Machine]], as well as the roots of this world, Ikabod was once a kind friend to many of the now legendary team “[[Critical Hit]]”, and asked their help in uncovering secrets found in the most ancient places of the world. His magical life-giving blade, Burstsweet, grew rusty with time as it fell into disuse.

## Disownment
After a mistake resulted in the [[Catharia Incident|death]] of reserve member [[Jakoby Cutler]], “Critical Hit” largely discarded him as an ally, and he fell into depression. At one point, Ikabod traveled to [[Drastic]], his home city, to hopefully rekindle his happiness, but it never returned with the noise of the city overwhelming his senses. He only ever found peace in his workshop, taking the occasional studuent and tinkering with machines and enchanting. This was a source of inspiration for him, imbuing items with his words, will, and power so they might survive him.

During this time, his master [[Succotash]] and him sparred, and shared notes on enchanting. While Succotash took the "imbuing of willpower" far more literally, the friendly rivalry that had burgeoned between the two rubbed off on Succotash's apprentice [[Werwin Krara]]. In addition, Ikabod attempted to find love in perhaps another avenue of finding reasons to live, and he partially did so, finding a very trusted friend in [[Flora Neeld]].

That was only about 19 years ago, but it already feels like ancient history.

## Current Affairs
Ikabod was one of the few mages trusted with the secret of the [[Dragonic Curse]], in order to help prince [[Lazuli Dino]] cure it. He created [[Visitant|visitants]] of the prince, including his surrogate daughters [[Locket]] and [[Pendant]], and discovered the roots of the [[curse]] where his forebears had failed. Inevitably, though, the secret was to leak out somewhere along the pipeline, and it did so with Ikabod inadvertently through [[Judia Naz]]. Despite this ruining his reputation yet further, he redoubled himself and assisted in the recompletion of the Stone of [[Golorr]], eventually resulting in the cure for the curse.
