A "**freshman charge**" or "**tephra charge**" is a well-packed pot of [[Rivenium|riven]] [tephra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tephra), collected from the cave networks of [[Mount Celestia]]. It naturally is suffused with a frankly immense amount of [[Light (property)|Light]]: to the point that holding it alone feels comforting and [[Vitality energy|positive]]. 

According to stories, it was originally created by mistake by a [[Constellar School]] apprentice, who apparently blinded himself and his dorm using it. It was later adopted as a last-resort stunning weapon by the [[Sacred Dragoon Force]].
