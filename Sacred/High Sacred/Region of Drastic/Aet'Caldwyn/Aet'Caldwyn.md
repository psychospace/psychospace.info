**Aet'Caldwyn** is a holy site on an island in the [[Grand Watersea]], commonly translated as "Lightstream Fortress". It is typically off-limits to the public. 

Its true form is that of a full island city in the style of [[old world]] ruins, hidden away by a complex water lock sealed by the [[Vault of Foreknowledge]] and the [[Vault of Foretelling]]. Its buildings were all marbled, sheer rock, like stone yet to be carved away. 

Deep inside was the full remnants of the [[blackflame]], origin of the [[Dragonic Curse]]. One of the last lines of defense the angels constructed to protect the blackflame are a pair of golems, powered by the [[halo|halos]] of [[Angel|angels]]: their names, translated from [[Celestial language|Celestial]], are **[[Lucid Sky]]** and **[[Coursing Stream]]**. The pair were originally commissioned by [[Aso ar'Carapa]].
