A **skysea**, also sometimes called a **sky ocean**, is a significant volume of thinned air in [[The Heavens]]. Skyseas separate the [[Remnant|remnants]] of the world by vast distances, and [[Airship|airships]] are typically constructed to traverse them. Skyseas hold patterns of [[Cloudscape|clouds]], producing [[Weather]].

*Sceography* is the study of the makeup of a skysea (used analogously to geography).

Many skyseas have been named:
- [[Mare del Monte]], the Sea of the Mountain
- [[Mer de Vide]], the Sea of the Void
- the [[Colossal Ocean]], the Sea of Souls

In antiquity, the [[Out There]] was called “the skysea without end”.
