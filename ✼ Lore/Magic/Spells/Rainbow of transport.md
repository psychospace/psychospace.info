***Rainbow of transport*** is a [[Conjuration|conjuration]] [[Spell|spell]] of moderate [[Arcane complexity|complexity]]. The spell requires a powerful [[Tribute]] source; in the case of the [[Tower of Electron]], which uses this spell persistently, this is a [[Power star|power star]].

Invented by [[Nery Ravenna]], the spell generates a massive [[rainbow]] which acts a conduit for physical objects, built of hard-light. The rainbow's end may, essentially, be anywhere on the [[remnant]] you are on. Although the rainbow itself is quite fragile, glassy pods may be sent through to take many people through the conduit at once.
