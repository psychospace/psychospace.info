Fanth is the [[Eidolon]] defender of [[Hope Springs]] who embodies harmony.

She is intrigued with both progress of society and respect to nature. She helps local farmers by discovering and dispelling threats to the crops, yet even so, the quietness of the city means she is often underprepared for an attack from the plants she loves so much. Her symbol is a vine.
