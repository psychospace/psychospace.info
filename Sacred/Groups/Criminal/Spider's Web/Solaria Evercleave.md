**Solaria Evercleave** was a former head of a clan of the [[Spider's Web]], specifically of the Farm. As a member of the [[Trinity Seven]], she was also by virtue an agent of the Tangle, and thus a worshipper of [[Ravus]].

Operating in [[Port Fester]], she sold monsters and other, more sentient specimens to black-market researchers across the Wild Blue Yonder. This often led to her clashing openly with those she tried to kidnap, but it was her namesake and her honor to bring an end to any bloodline she set her eyes on if they so defied her.

However, she was killed by [[Alexios Hawthorne]], after [[Valain Stalwart]] was contracted by Solaria to kill his sister, [[Melia Hawthorne]].
