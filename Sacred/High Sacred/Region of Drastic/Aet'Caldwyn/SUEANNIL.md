"**SUEANNIL**" was a dormant female clone of [[Lazuli Dino|Linnie]], not technically a [[Visitant]], created by [[Ikabod Caruso]]. 

Sue was reduced to slush and ice when their [[Soul]] was extracted and placed in the [[Heart container]] in [[Maline Tower]].

Its never-existent mind was eventually latched onto by [[Arahabaki]], who used it as a puppet when meeting the [[S4]] while inside the [[L'ipotesi|unreal space]] containing the [[Invertebra]].
