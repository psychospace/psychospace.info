**Es'kys Uliiz** is the current Golden Emir, a talos, figurehead and vote-controller of the [[Golden Council]]. Also known to his political opponents as “Ass-Kiss”, he’s widely seen as a weak leader for [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qaulhain]], mostly due to being bullied into actions by other members of [[The Shibboleth]]. Under his rule, [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Winifreyad]] has begun to seek further autonomy in his region.
