The **Invertebra** was the collective title for the physical apparatus holding the planet-bound pieces of the [[Blackflame]], bound within the [[Cathedral of the Womb]].

Using the [[L'ipotesi|L'Ipotesi Manuscript]] and an angelic apparatus called the **Slingshot**, real beings could be translated inside an *unreal* space, where the blackflame was intended to be sequestered outside all possible existence. When this failed to destroy the being, an [[evangel]] of low-repute decided to watch over the flame for all eternity.

It was initially bound in a crystal diadem, but over time that prison melted.
