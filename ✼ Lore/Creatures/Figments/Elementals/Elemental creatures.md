Generated out of [[Chaos]], as the conflux of the four axioms, **elemental [[Creature|creatures]]** (sometimes simply called "elementals") are powerful [[Figment|figments]] which collectively are the physical manifestations of the influence of [[elemental energy]] in the [[Antic Sea]]. 

Almost all elementals do not have any sense of sapience, acting much like animals (even with immense psionic power). The exceptions are known as [[Whill|whills]].

There are several strata of elemental creatures.
