The **Manteian Institutional Conservatory of [[Karyos]]**, commonly known as “**the Fifth Institute**”, the Manteian Conservatory, or “*MICK*”, is both a place of learning (and development) and a place which concentrates the authority and collective knowledge of the remnant into a self-defense force. 

Many technological developments which emerged or evolved in this age began at MICK. Their crest is a yellow rose.

# Etymology
Its short-name, "the Fifth Institute", is because it is the fifth-such university of learning that [[Bullion]] has formed: of these, only the [[Second Institute|Second]] and [[Third Institute|Third]] still stand today. It wasn't until the stability created by the [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|research protectorate]] that a university could emerge of this quality, and it is regarded widely as a shining jewel of the remnant.

# Mission
The Institute, aside from being a university, has a tradition of pursuing leads fervently, in studied "questions" called [[Perícopa]] and individual research efforts known as [[Opus|opuses]]. Using [[Chirologist|chirologists]], the Conservatory has many ground-level investigations ongoing at one time, each called **cantos**.

At the same time, the authorities behind the Institute, under their [[Karyan Commissioner]] and the [[Alect Keeper|Alect Keepers]], have a reputation for keeping many of their more dangerous findings and interests hidden and protected. 

As of [[1285 PT]], the Institute is obsessed with [[Perícopa Doce]], its research into [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpins]]. Its operators almost mercilessly hunts to contain lynchpins, rumored lynchpins, and [[Psion|psions]], seeking to research their effects and discover more about their origins and purpose, as well as form countermeasures.

As a manner of national security, it’s an open secret they want to make sure [[New Magic|new-magic]] doesn’t tear the world raised on old-magic apart, an open secret which keeps a lot of dangers from acting out: its arguable that their failure to react quickly when new-magic started to proliferate led to groups like [[Single-Brain Cell|SBC]].
