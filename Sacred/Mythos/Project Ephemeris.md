**Project Ephemeris** was a national project of the [[Sacred Royal Ultra]], initiated during the beginning of the [[Dragonic War]] by Queen [[Velocis Dino]]. It allowed its members to credit any costs necessary to the [[Kingdom of Sacred|Kingdom]] in order to pursue and retrieve Prince [[Lazuli Dino|Linnie]] from the [[Nortian Conspiracy]].

It was [[âŽ‰ Declaration of Project Ephemeris|declared]] on the first day of [[1251 PT]]. During its short period of operation, it captured many bases back from the [[Heartknock]], and helped to enable the victory of the [[S4]].


# Fate
After [[Zero Day]], the [[Dragonic War]] began a steady downturn as [[Serena Nortia]] reclaimed her country from the Conspiracy's wrath, and Lazuli was returned to the Kingdom. The efforts of Project Ephemeris evolved with the downturn, and eventually the Project became a joint effort on behalf of both the Empire and Kingdom in order to alleviate harm caused by the Conspiracy. 

Ephemeris's formal purpose was retracted in the month of Arkea, 1251. Eventually, Ephemeris's leadership and organization were folded into the [[Order of Hope]].
