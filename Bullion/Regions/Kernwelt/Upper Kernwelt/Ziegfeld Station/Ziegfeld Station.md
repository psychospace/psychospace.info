**Ziegfeld Station** is a moderately well-off town in the [[Upper Kernwelt]].

In the sandy shadow of a grand mesa, the town is kind of like the definition of middle-class in the [[Kernwelt]], since though the [[train]] brings a lot of business through that area, including a yard where the engines can seek repair, the town parts of the town (see: where people live) are very out of fashion and in need of refurbishment on their own.

A decently-staffed [[Blue Cinder Militia]] regiment, no doubt funded by the train’s owners, [[Lainese Heavy Industries]], has the place ticking over, keeping the wilderness critters in check and property lines protected. 

But to “normal people”, it’s definitely a place steeped in a vibe where one can go a little stir-crazy living in a peaceful but static state: knowing these types of factors, an outsider would definitely believe that a sensational newsletter about magic and esoterica like the Grind could spring out of this otherwise fairly standard frontier-business town.
# Layout
Though the main thoroughfare composed of three main streets and a number of industrial buildings, outer dilapidated neighborhoods seem to continue out into the tree line at the base of the large butte, topped with a U-shaped stone outcropping, almost like a horseshoe.

Inside the lavish trainyard, the hum of lux engines, and hissing steam of their output, underscore a stench of hot stones and various belongings. It is quiet of people this morning, though the postman is almost always cheerily welcoming people in, expecting businessmen. 

## Plaza
The plaza, visible from the hilltop, is an open-air thoroughfare largely marked by the colorful cloths hung between buildings, blowing in the wind and mostly protecting the city center from the elements. Larger buildings, marked with industrial logos, box in the square on all sides. For a city with only three primary streets, there's impressive attention to detail paid with the convenience of its center, crowned with a well.

The local bar is the [[Ten Acres Pub]]. This is where [[Pablo's Masterworks Publishing]] operates from, as well as their weird-world newspaper, the [[Daily Grind]].
