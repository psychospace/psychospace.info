Sakuya and Ninigi were both ancient [[Dragon#Chromatic|chromatic dragons]] who became parent to near-divine lineages.

Together, they bore Umisachi, Yamasachi, Hosuseri, and Tomanoya inside the [[Starcrater Fields|Starcrater Caves]]. These dragons, now **[[Arahabaki]]**, **[[Uforia]]**, **[[Sekkan-shin]]**, and **[[Vergoldeter Minutenzeiger Panikdrache|Vergoldeter]]**, have changed the world in their absence.

Both were turned to gems as a result of some disease, likely related to Arahabaki's power or the [[Blackflame]] they bore their eggs on. A claw of Sakuya and small scale of Ninigi became forged into [[Dinofang]], while the town of [[Sapphire]] was so named for the nearby tomb where Ninigi's crystallized corpse lied.
