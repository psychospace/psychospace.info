**Margaryda Archegon** is a [[Raghain|Ragi]]-[[Karyos|Kary]] professor, the current [[Lord President]] of [[the Shibboleth]] of [[Bullion]], and current [[Alect Commissioner]] of the [[Fifth Institute]]. 

She was elected in [[1280 PT]] amid [[taphrine]] plague and rising animosity against [[Numberless Children|Nulk]] activities. The voting-in of a professor of sciences, rather than a traditional political figure, was seen as a strong vote of no-confidence in the current â€™s ability to deal with the alterations wrought by [[New Magic|new magic]].

Born and raised in [[Karyos]], Margaryda was mostly sworn in by her affiliation with old money aligned against new magic, something she repeatedly preached in her tenure as commissioner of the Institute.
