A **tribute**, also called a "tribute cost", is a general term in [[Magic]] which refers to components of [[Spell|spells]] or [[alchemy|potions]] beyond the caster's body or intentions. These must be provided and usually consumed in order to generate a magic effect. 

This cost, is usually tied to the [[Arcane complexity|arcane complexity]] of the effect in question: for example, [[Resurrection]] generally requires an emotional tribute to succeed. It is in a caster's best interest to experiment and find ways of reducing the tribute as much as possible, hence why [[Compilation|compilation]] is important. 

The nature of tributes is tied to [[Psychospace|psychospacial]] worth. Potent emotions or connections, or objects of high material or sentimental wealth, will affect psychospace more than weaker or more insincere ones. The inverse of that principle means that to affect psychospace more, one requires more potent components.

When a tribute is not provided (when it is required), the spell will often "consume" other things, possibly at random and without the caster's knowledge, in excess of the effect and complexity. For example, when [[Serena Nortia]] rescued [[Shohei Integra]] from the sudden disconnection of his soul, the tribute cost was her [[Serena's prosthesis|leg]].

[[Ritual|Rituals]] commit time and dedication as tribute, in addition to hoping to achieve their ambitious effects.
