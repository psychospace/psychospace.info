**Pendant** is a [[Visitant]] of [[Lazuli Dino]], created by [[Ikabod Caruso]].

Crafted from the prince's sense of creativity, she was Ikabod's seventh creation for the purpose of curing the [[Dragonic Curse]]. She is actually a copy of [[Locket]], the sixth creation, for use as a "backup".

Her soul was bound to Ikabod's through the [[Lifeblinding|mark of lifeblind]]. During [[Red Spark]], she fled Drastic with Ikabod.
