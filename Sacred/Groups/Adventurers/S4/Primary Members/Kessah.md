# History
Kessah was born with the innate magic of the Champions of Barbiche after the death of her great grandfather, who had possessed the magic before her.

In [[1250 PT]], when Kessah was tasked with bringing the yearly offerings to the mountaintop, the dragon's voice called to her and gave her a quest. Kessah is fairly energetic and loves to hum and play the viola. She's never left her village before and is excited about almost everything that's new to her. Especially technology. Despite growing up in an isolated village, Kessah is fairly sociable.

Even before her birth Kessah was expected to play an important role in her community. She never let the pressures of her destiny, vague as it may have been, weigh her down, however. And her status as the current Champion made her very popular amongst her peers. She grew up to be a very sociable and likeable individual, never really letting her popularity and importance fuel her ego.

Her parents and the village elders always pushed for her to learn how to hone in her innate arcane abilities by studying the texts left behind by Champions of the past or practicing her magic in general. Though Kessah did enjoy using her abilities and learning what she was capable of, she never cared much for reading the notes of old men and wanted instead to come to her powers on her own... also cuz she was lazy with her studies. Besides, it had been decades since any Champion had to use their gifts for more than helping the village with a bountiful harvest or fixing up a few old houses.

Her interest in the arcane arts grew when she was tasked with delivering the yearly offering to the mountaintop for the Silver Dragon. The rest of her village had already gone up to set their offerings. As always, she was to be the last to set her offering and make the journey alone. When she set her gifts at the dragon's shrine, a chilly breeze brushed past her, carrying with it a voice that spoke to her in Draconic. It told her of a coming conflict, how her time to prove herself to her people, to her Dragon, and to her own person was to come. This was the first sign of the Silver Dragon's presence since it went dormant years ago. And it was the catalyst that drove Kessah into her arcane studies. She studied the texts of her ancestors, practiced her magic when she could. She had even begun making short trips outside the safety of her village to gain more experience using her abilities in the open world.

Eventually, she witnessed [[Red Spark]], and her calling to adventure had come.

# Personality

She always disguises her horns and lower half, passing as elven. Kessah's Draconic traits start with her horns. Two ridged silver horns that protrude back from the top of her skull. Her left arm has patches of scales, the biggest patch covering her shoulder. They are mostly silver in color, but fade to a pale gold at her forearm. Her teeth are a little sharper than normal, but it's subtle. When she exerts a large burst of arcane energy, the scales pulse like a wave and become more pronounced, as well as her teeth; her pupils shifting closer to a dragons.



Kessah is 22.
