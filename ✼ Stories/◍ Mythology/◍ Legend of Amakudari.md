*We breathe life into your story, O Amazakisuishousekiju-no-Ookami,<br>O Great Scholar God of Amethyst who Split the Heavens.<br>Your tragedy was the genesis of these [[The Shibboleth|seven peoples]] of [[Bullion]],<br>The story of [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]], the Earthbound Exalted One.*

*Once upon a time, long, long ago, [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|these lands]] were ruled by a brilliant dragon.<br>This mighty dragon came from on high, descending upon these lands with a host of its allies.<br>Beasts of the sky caught its tailwind, crafting a procession which stretched miles long.<br>Its mind was as sharp as a stone, keener than all but the wisest of its time.*

*Though it fled from [[The Above|a kingdom of storm]], it came to this world with hopeful eyes.<br>The dragon would bring its people a world unlike the sky they had sailed before.<br>The dragon would go on to forge a new legacy: its own ocean, its own destiny. <br>Free to fight its own battles, it would honor the birthright it'd been granted.*

*When Amakudari was a wyrmling, it plucked a star from the night sky.<br>In thieving a star, its soul found unsurmountable power, an infinite spring of life.<br>But no matter how brilliant, this star shattered into dust in the hands of the child. <br>It did not yet understand how to hold this power in its own hands.*

*Temperance was the first lesson the young dragon learned.<br>Magic is all around each and every living thing, bound by the aether of the mind,<br>Tying us in an everlasting community, under the great sky that gathers us.<br>Amakudari, in its juvenile way, dared to seek a higher calling.*

*"What if I were to transcend this sky that unites us?" It pondered. <br>"Does possibility stretch ever onwards, into infinity? What lies beyond the clouds?"<br>"Could it be, one day, that I will hold the power of the stars in my own hands?"<br>"Will I reach [[Welkin|the height]] of the very [[Divinity|gods]], if only I travel far enough?"*

*With ambition to this tune, the dragon mastered many arcane arts.<br>The amethyst wyrm knew that this was the only way its life could be.<br>The dragon continued to suffuse itself of astral power which drifted through the clouds,<br>And soon enough, came to draw on that unsurmountable power.*

*When Amakudari had reached adulthood, it had achieved its ultimate potential:<br>With [[Reality-Bending|just a thought]], it could fly through the [[universe]], time and space altogether, instantly.<br>It fathomed its [[Epitome|entire life]], from first conception… to its end, as a kind, benevolent ruler. <br>No matter where it wished, no matter when, its will would simply be done.*

*With this, the dragon witnessed marvelous worlds of unrecognized majesty.<br>Innumerable virgin realms beyond the [[Dark Sea]]. Things none can picture. Peoples of the stars.<br>The dragon adored this [[Gift of Stars|gift]], used it for centuries, and yet felt less than whole, alone.<br>In its lengthy absence from its homeworld, it longed more and more to share its glory with them.*

*But the gods had witnessed this uncontrolled prowess once before.<br>With the [[The Gathering|collapse of sensical nature]], reality was stretched to its limits.<br>This was an approach to the end of all things, and resulted in a pact,<br>Never to allow the voiding of the rules of the [[Divine Equation]].*

*And when this pact was again grievously threatened by disregard for space and time<br>The dragon was visited by [[Amakudari's phantom|itself]]: an apparition, in warning.<br>The vision told the dragon, if it ever returned to [[The Planet]] it came from,<br>It would never be allowed to leave ever again.*

*It would surrender its domain to the gods, or it would never return home again.<br>The dragon was troubled, unsure. If it were to ever share its joy with its kindred,<br>that would spell the end of its long, long journeys into infinity.<br>Amakudari pondered many possibilities though its options were two.*

*But, determined to bring about great discovery,<br>The dragon had resolve unlike anything the gods thought.<br>And so it returned. Amakudari forged a society, [[Ith'Paraan]], its Land of the Storm<br>and ruled it with care, all in search of the secrets of the multiverse.*

*Amakudari twisted the nature of life, sought any possibility for evolution.<br>Its people were devout, willing to make grave sacrifices to this end.<br>It toyed with the very gods, danced within their threat freely.<br>And its people called the dragon their Truest Lord of Storm.*

*And when time came, those people built [[Void Breaker|vessels that could climb to the stars]].<br>Their own boreal wings carried them home into the realm the dragon knew.<br>The skysea without end, which they called [[Out There|Graciosa]], the Infinite Grace. <br>And the dragon's wishes were granted, his gift now a blessing over all.*

*And yet the dragon knew an uneasy truth, which it knew well…<br>Amakudari could not come with them, not ever. Never to witness the gifts it brought them.<br>Now, it was the one who must only listen to their tales of glory and exultation.<br>Never to indulge the urge for expansion and discovery. In this, the itch grew and grew.*

*After a millennium of glory, the dragon, fueled again by that great Ambition,<br>Stood in guise upon a voidbreaker one winters' morn, confident that it had been wrong.<br>These people's Lord would break the prophecy that bound it to the Planet.<br>For just a single fleeting moment, Amakudari had a singular doubt.*

*And then, as suddenly, their captain lay dead from no explicable cause.<br>The vessel turned to crystal, and their Truest Lord would never recover.<br>The grim promise he had delivered himself had come to pass.<br>In trying to shatter the yoke of the gods, Amakudari had only [[Altercation|sealed its fate]].*
<br>*And so it was, that [[Ith'Alnna|two centuries of nightmare]] followed.*

*A [[Angel's cough|plague]] ravaged the people. Those who survived came out unrecognizable.<br>Droughts dried the lakes and streams, parching the people.<br>Winds blew about the dust that once was called farmland.<br>The land itself drew its last breath as mountains cracked and churned.*

*All prayers for mercy were silenced when the [[Os'Grun]] impact occured.<br>Their Lord had gone, their Land had gone, and now, their People had gone.*

*That Wandering Fist made a punctuating, devastating mark.<br>Nothing of the Land of Storm remained alive, sealed beneath the shattered world.<br>Those who had taken to the sky would never be able to recall their fatherland.<br>The gods had, with one trespass, closed Amakudari's tale through their own hands.*

*Much, much later, long after the nightmare had passed,<br>People of [[Archipel|the lands of water and ice]] arrived in these lands.<br>The rivers again flowed, the gods' vengeance sated, and life burgeoned anew.<br>The ambitions of the past, their story, survived by a seedling.*

*In these [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]], that land of the storm, the great Ambition, is reborn anew.<br>O, Amazakisuishousekiju, your gift lives on in every one of us.<br>When you look to the night sky, simply imagine the wonders they must have seen.<br>And you, too, child of the storm: you shall be there…*
