**New Orc City** (*Novo Orkrengrad*) is the capital city of the [[Great Nortian Empire]]. Built surrounding [[Orkrengrad]], its predecessor, it acts as the premier throne of power for the Empress. It is surrounded by the cities known as the [[Cradling Hand]], and is the ancient site of [[Valerian]]'s appeal.

Mired in the political soup of the empire, New Orc City is a place where many commoners go to seek strong employment. 

Its population was around 43,000 as of the [[Dragonic War]].
