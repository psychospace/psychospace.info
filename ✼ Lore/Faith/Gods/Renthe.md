**Renthe** is the god of mechanics and physics, child of [[Athemat]] with no known mother. Born to Athemat at the same time [[Calcula]] was born to [[Cientia]], spiritually linking the two. Effectively, Renthe is the "law of nature" and all that bind it.

Renthe has done battle with many gods of chaos, which corrupt its mechanical, "set" nature. It occasionally fragments itself, removing corrupted pieces which withhold its own power and the influence of its opponent, as a manner of cleansing: these fragments often fall to [[the Planet]] in the form of objects like "[[Ring of Renthe|The Machine]]". Most of these are contained within the [[Giia|flipside of Pinwheel]].
