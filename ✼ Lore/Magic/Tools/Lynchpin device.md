![[⎋ 2FPG]]
A term originally coined by Dr. [[Mujtaba Shahin]], a “**lynchpin device**” is an archetypal and anomalous object, phenomenon, or person who exhibits highly strange and ethereal properties, most of which do not follow expected bounds of the [[Divine Equation]].

# History
These objects are said to be originally created of a brokered peace between [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]] and [[Divinity]] (through an alliance with the [[Outsider|Outsiders]]), after the former [[The Gathering|encroached]] on the latter's domains. 

The term “lynchpin” refers to the perceived intention of creating these, which was to codify specific rules that overlay all of creation and create these devices which assure them.

Due to the high concentration of elemental chaos and related history, many devices exist on the remnant of [[Bullion]]. 

# Properties
It is unknown how many lynchpins exist or have existed.

Lynchpins can be identified, distinguished from magic items, by three primary factors:
1. a type of [[Gravity|gravity]] between identified lynchpins, such as through hosts of [[Triplicate]].
2. by their age through *[[legend lore]]*, making them notably powerful [[Antique|artifacts]].
3. by their resistance to existing enchanted objects, such as resisting the demiplane of a [[bag of holding]].

Destroying a device apparently results in a new one appearing elsewhere in the world for entirely separate purposes, though with similar effects. Dr. Shahin termed this "recurrence". For example, though the [[Ring of Renthe|ring of Renthe]] exists today as a ring, it is known to [[Pinwheel]] that relics with identical effects have once emerged as blades, hammers, and even fine china. ^858a3c

Most inanimate devices can be "hosted", which is a process similar to attunement to magical items. Some devices are themselves animate, and are also called lynchpins.
