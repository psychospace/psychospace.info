**Valerie Stout** is a [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Freyite]] [[anadi]] [[Wizardry|wizard]], a student and later [[Alect Keeper]] of the [[Fifth Institute]], serving as the keeper of [[Lenore Arviel]].

Hailing from [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Winifreyad]], she is a relatively well-off researcher, specializing in the field of archaeoarcanology, the origins of magic. Her research began [[Perícopa Veintisiete]], leading to her meteoric rise in clout.
# History
Not much is known of Stout's upbringing.

In [[1249 PT]], Valerie was late in her research at the Conservatory and was vying to become a [[High Manteian]], effectively climbing the bureaucracy of the Fifth Institute to become an important figure in her field. Working on a thesis on [[Confluence|confluxes]] in the [[Upper Kernwelt]] region, she rented out the basement of [[Julia Gutierrez]], a newspaper editor from [[Ziegfeld Station]] who became romantically interested in Stout.

One month after [[TRUE NAME (12-242)|a body of TRUE NAME]] was revived by [[The Pitcher]] and divorced from its collective, Valerie was contacted by TRUE NAME. She offered them a job, helping unpack her [[Bag of holding|bags of holding]] full of notes into an esoteric organization system. Valerie also encouraged Julia to offer the bounty through the [[Daily Grind]], hoping to research the entity that 12-242 was revived by.

Through that opportunity, the two of them broke the story on the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]], and by completing a full study on the Pitcher and the vanishing of [[skitball]] both as a result of [[Ciro Enfys]], [[Perícopa Veintisiete]] opened, around the same time that [[Zero Day]] occurred.

From there, it was short order for her to continue to research the [[New God Phenomenon]], eventually becoming an Alect Keeper.
