**Farborough Manor** is the long-standing estate of [[House Parasom]]. As of [[1251 PT]], it was the home of [[Illarion Parasom|Illarion]], [[Amanita Parasom|Amanita]], [[Octavia Parasom|Octavia]], and [[Scarla Nitrum|Scarla Parasom]].

 It is located inside the [[Dreamgate]] district of [[New Orc City]], blending in with many of the more modern buildings through gallant gardens. The "house" parts of the manor are well-blocked off from the public parts, mostly as a security and comfort measure.

# History
The [[Kalashtar|kalashtar]] of the name Parasom have inhabited Farborough Manor for generations, holding many official functions there: parties, operas, and concerts and the like.

In [[1245 PT]], Amanita and Octavia discovered the fundamental [[Plane]] known as [[The Fortress|the Fortress]] while researching in the Manor's sub-level, creating a pocket using the instructions in *[[Visage of the Fortress]]*. 

Since 1245 PT, the house was undergoing consistent renovations year over year, in addition to Lord Parasom spending less time there. The official reason given to [[Serena Nortia]] was to facilitate "additional research archival", though the truth was that the Fortress-pocket required more and more mitigation.

In [[1249 PT]], the Fortress-pocket temporarily caused the manor to vanish from existence. 

Eventually, as part of the precautions taken by the [[Nortian Conspiracy]] just before [[1251 PT]], the pocket bound to the manor was "snagged" to the primary stairwell of the [[Nail of Nortia]], preventing access to the higher floors so as to protect the investigations of the [[Masterwork Laboratory]] into the kidnapped [[Linnaeus Dino]].
