**Firearms** or **guns** are weapons which propel projectiles using explosive force. A relatively recent development in [[the Heavens]], firearms are useful at range in all kinds of conditions. They are typically developed for unpredictable environments where killing or disabling your target swiftly is a must.

They were first reverse-engineered from hypothetical works designed by [[Nunes Daedal]], a progenitor to [[Viers Callinan]]. 

# Types

## Mounted firearms

Invested in chemistry and metallurgy due to its twin remnants, and perhaps for other reasons too, the [[Great Nortian Empire|Great Empire of Nortia]] was the first to invent the **cannon**, which quickly propagated for its ability to improve the speed of conquest. No longer would magicians need to train many years to be able to operate on a ship: now any common man could blast apart their foes with ease. ^b7417d

As with many developments in weaponry, this triggered an arms race over the past two centuries, leading to many advancements in mechanical understanding, including the fusion of magic and technology in the form of modern [[alchemy]] (including [[lux]] infrastructure, which further enhanced magical research). This also, on the more dour side of things, led to the events of the [[War of the Masters]], as technologically superior nations exerted colonial invasion on those weaker in the [[Colossal Ocean]].

## Handheld firearms
Handheld firearms are still not yet in great numbers as of [[1250 PT]], although they have been rising in popularity to match the creation of a mysterious superweapon known as the [[Psychobullet]]. This legendary piece of ammunition, usually crafted for cannons, would be far more effective as an assassination tool and far more efficient to produce if it could be fired by one person instead of with a crew of twelve onboard an airship. Similarly, enchanting a firearm is an equally complex process, so they are in even fewer numbers.

### Morgan Crossbow
The most well known handheld firearm in current year is the **morgan crossbow**, which is a scoped crossbow capable of firing red-hot bolts far into the horizon line crafted by famed [[Pinwheel]] engineer **Morgana Laufie.** It is essentially a crossbow with explosive pieces. 

### Handdragon
The most elite of the [[City & Castle]] Guards in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] are equipped with a new form of firearm aptly called a **handdragon**, a sidearm they use in their off-hand, capable of firing round shot with such a spin that even hitting armor or shields won't stop it from skidding off and carving more damage into its targets.

### Rifle-axes
**Rifle-axes**, fusing the length of a long firearm and the heft of an axe, were early developments in the post-[[War of the Masters|war]] period of Nortia, and its creation represented the pinnacle of their early exploration of their modern [[Nortian imperial family#Horizon Walker|spellblade style]]. [[Homecoming]] is a premier example, with the [[Model H-1]] being designed after it.

The axe-head is intended to be used while sieging forts or taking on heavy beasts, while at range its heft assists in stabilizing the barrel. It can also hold an electrical charge, able to channel through and fry somebody wearing armor from within.
## Blastgun
A **blastgun** is a firearm (typically handheld) which uses [shaped explosions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaped_charge), typically as its means of attack or for some other function of the gun. 

Using chemical accelerants packed into its [[Nail|Nail]] cartridges, a blastgun can puncture armor and produce immense amounts of directed energy, making it useful (if not overkill) against organic targets and extremely effective against metallic targets. As a direct result, though, the gun itself must be reinforced against severe impact: as [[Cordyte Amak]] once said, a good blastgun is as much a weapon against the enemy as it is against the user.

It is effective for environments where physical projectiles would be repelled, but energy projectiles would pass through, or for more directed forms of attack where damaging the surroundings is not an option, such as in sensitive buildings, jungle environments, or for home defense.

Blastrifles are commonly seen fielded by the [[Blue Cinder Militia]] and [[sganyodaiyo]], who typically use the SIIR-63 or -65, known for having an impressive 6.3m maximum range.
