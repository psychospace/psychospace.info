*That lonesome night*, the sword weighed far heavier than the crown. 

The flashes of lightning outdoors and the night rains beating on the windows out front barely fazed [[Lazuli Dino|Linnie]], as he sat there on the creaky old barstool. Aside him, there was a leak sprung in the roof, dripping rhythmically into a pot on the ground, breaking through the wall-to-ceiling murals. The paint flowed amorphous cloud around the falling water, a clear sky punctuated by a dull black hole.

There was always that gut feeling that his life would lead him in one big circle, that the dog days of his young life blurring into each other would lead to his last moments. The prince would always twitch awake at the worst hours, some aspect of himself afraid to let his body sleep soundly, knowing what dwelt within. 

No matter where Linnaeus walked, he knew he was walking someone else’s path. No matter how he tried, he was always somehow against the grain. For twenty years, he’d toed the line. Alone, save Ildy.

*Alone.* Without fail.

*Drip. Drip. Drip.*

The young prince glanced at the water splashing about from the sky on high into a metal pot, in the corner of the room. He considered the lavender flower he was twirling between his fingers, plucked from the [[Destiny Cathedral|floating cathedral]]’s garden. A loop of rest and unrest, of knowing and not. It was a forlorn, improvised ritual, to calm his mind from the eerie silence that flooded his mind, the occasional booming outside shaking the foundations of the building in the meanwhile. 

Alas, the sign on the door was indeed true. “No matter what the weather is, come inside and drink to your health, with calm winds and [[Cien|sun]] on high.” [[Clear Skies Pub|Clear Skies, indeed.]] …Just a shame his mind was so damn cloudy.

His expression darkened as he saw a petal flit from the blossom, drifting to the ground beside his scabbard. 

Was he about to do something stupid? Yes. Probably. Was he about to do something *careless*? That, he did not know. He had never gone through with these inclinations before. He trusted so many people, but nobody, he thought, *nobody* enough for this. Nobody for how brazen this was. This is unnatural of him, wasn’t it? Wouldn’t Ildy have a say in this decision…?

But… was that simply his *mother* talking? Is it not right to speak one’s mind, to buck tradition when one needs to? A matter of national import, that's what mom would call it. The thoughts all swam about in his head.

He no longer knew how to tell what was and wasn’t acceptable, anymore. Does staying silent keep the peace, really? All the rules were in flux. And with what the [[Ikabod Caruso|wizard]] was trying, perhaps any new confidant would be a comfort worth taking.

And… Oh, *gods*… the [[Destiny Cathedral|cathedral]]. Only hours ago, but a decade in the making. That’s what brought all this on. That [[Magnet (tiefling)|tiefling]]… He should *never have*--

A trembling fist fell to the bar. A moment of weakness.

Unwelcome tears began to well up as the glass was emptied once again, trying desperately to drown the memory in fog. The glass landed in front of him: empty, save a glacier of ice, a mirror that looked back at him.

Linnie knew how dour His Highness might’ve seemed, were anybody passing on the rain-dappled pavestones outside. And yet he found little reason to mind them: if they *thought* he was depressed — 

— well, now, they might be onto something. 

A rasping cough as the liquor hit the back of his throat. That was a sign that his recollection was too difficult to ignore. A groan arose instead.

It was that vacant look that had passed across the visage of Master [[Werwin Krara|Werwin]], the man who'd opened his heart to their group. That gods-forsaken look. The halfling's brain was wracking for a reality buried under two meters of mental stones. Stuck endlessly recollecting something, desperately losing information he knew was there somewhere deep down… but was left empty.

To Lin, and Lin alone, it was no question why. When the prince was a child, Werwin’s mind was partly vanished by a court sorcerer, on his mother the queen’s orders. For the sanctity of all. For the secrecy. For his failure. The prince was probably the only one who remembered what had happened.

Yet more guilt for the royal pile, wasn’t it. Just another in a long list of regrets. Tonight was just like that one night, eight years ago... the night that... 

Linnie mumbled another [[curse#Curse words|curse]] under his breath. The lavender lost another petal as a step hit the top of the stairs.

---
*THUD!* 

The bolt cut through the wind, but it found no purchase. The tail of the practice-arrow sagged, defeatedly, out the end of the hay sack, far shy of any kind of target.

[[Aster Claudius|Aster]]'s  eyes deviated from the glassy sight tied onto the bow to stare down range. “Aww, *damn!*” he protested loudly, echoing cleanly off the stone brick courtyard.

“Hey!” Linnie playfully shushed.

The early morning sun was still hiding behind the tall peaks of [[Saurus Castle]], leaving the training grounds quiet, in the shade. Still, it was plainly obvious the arrow had hit aught but the dead-zone, easy enough to see from where the boys stood.

The young prince's hair had grown long, pulled back into a ponytail braided with rings. “Terrible shot or *not*, you shouldn't blaspheme on castle grounds.”

To that, the page, clad in a blue squire's uniform, kicked the dirt, his bow string free of tension. Aster wasn’t one to fear the [[Tyranno Re Ursus|king-consort]]’s impotent wrath, but Lin’s mother, the [[Velocis Dino|queen]]? He’d stay his tongue before he made any kind of mess with her.

He tempered his response. "Darn, then. Darn it *all*. And you can *keep* your rules, then, *angel boy*." 

Aster's focus improved half a tic as they vaulted the barricade and pushed their willpower into the air. The sourcepoint above their heart glowed with energy, a light inside them sprung to life, and then it all took shape. A hand formed out of glimmering blue light reached and yearned down-range, curled its fingers around the feathered-stick. With some strain, it pulled free the practice arrow, retracing its arc before vanishing. 

After Aster's magic suspended it above him, he turned and bowed. “Does that please your majesty?”

“Sure, fine,” Lin pardoned, laughing, waving a free hand through the cool morning air as though he were casting a spell as well. It hardly mattered to the young prince, anyway. “Just clear the range.”

The magic hand deposited the blunt arrow into Aster’s grasp, but his eyes were locked on something behind Linnaeus. His body froze solid. It wasn't fear that seized him, so much as it was attention. He knew this was coming. He simply didn't want to account for it. 

“Aster, come on, man. Move,” commanded the young prince, ignorant of the rapidly approaching steps behind him. "Lemme take a shot."

"*Young master*," a commanding voice spoke.

And so, the young master spun on his feet. Behind him, half a meter taller, were the softened draconic features of [[Ildy]]. The [[eidolon]] cut a strange picture, standing there so intensely and seriously. 

Most of its body was covered by a coat of short, soft, white fur. A mane of pastel greens, reds, and pinks, the color of petals in a garden, was swept back and curled down to Ildy's back, and had been the same in style and length since the day Lin, or Ildy for that matter, was born. The eidolon's bespoke white wings were humbly draped over its shoulders, like a noble's half-cape. Its calming, almost toy-like visage, was accentuated by its black suede raiments, whose sleeves were just a bit too long and seemed fused into its form. 

A pair of orangeish five-pointed stars-for-pupils glared intently at the young prince, who swallowed his pride. 

Despite the evident psychic aura which projected a feeling of calm around the [[Drastic|capital]]'s eidolon, Lin could hear Aster behind him shift nervously. The pair weren't used to getting caught unawares, especially not when they were having fun.

"I thought you might be here," chided the girl on Ildy's left. Lin knew her blonde, pale countenance well. She was the same age as Linnie; she, like him, was a lordling, and a young knight-to-be. "No training for us, I guess?"

"Who told you you could *spoil* it, [[Lylian Burgitsk|Lyli]]?!" retorted the royal page behind Lin, defiantly. "This wasn't meant to be an *all-of-us* thing. This was just a me-and-Linnie thing!"

"[[Mistral Taylor Burgitsk|Mistral]] was awake," spoke Lylian plainly, as though it made inherent sense. Her arms gestured to the shield-bubble, which flickered pinkly around the castle and the grounds surrounding them, glimmering only faintly in the mid-morning light. "Opening the gate sets off alarms in her head. *Didn't you know that?* You would know that."

"That is *enough*, Lylian." Ildy's voice was measured, always at an appropriate pace and tone. "I appreciate your assistance, but your guidance is enough." 

Lyli receded into her chain armor. "Of *course*, sir," she smirked.

The eidolon turned to the prince, its expression turning worried. 

"You know you had us worried sick, lad."

"Why? Why can't you just trust me?" the prince impulsively asked, fully knowing the answer. "I *don't* have to tell you everything, do I?"

"You don't, no," the figment responded, self-assured. "But we had no idea where you'd run off to."

Lylian, for her part, *did* look like she was worried. She had a tendency to coat her more sensitive persona in mythril-grade snark, but like the greatest heroes she idolized, only did so out of concern for others.

"And young master Claudius," Ildy glanced over Linnie's shoulder. "I expected more of your behavior, especially. If you're to grow up responsible for matters of royal import, you ought to try a little harder to act responsibly now."

"But we were training!" Aster whined.

"One does not *train* on a practice range, without alerting the rangemaster on duty. Negligent of procedure... or *playing*, is what that is," Ildy said, raising a furry finger of accusation, with the slightest hint of sardonic irony. "If you'd like for there to be a next time, exercise proper caution."

All the rebellious spirit drained out of Aster all at once. "Yes, sir."

And with that, the figment delegated. "Madam Burgitsk, please take young master Claudius away for a moment. I'd like to speak with the prince in private."

"*Yer coming to the slammer*," announced Lylian, "*fer the crime of having fun without me.*" Her slightly-too-big chainmail shirt jangled as she and Aster wandered over to the far edge of the fencing which surrounded the practice range.

Linnaeus looked frustrated, his hands balled into fists at his sides, at the interruption. He didn't know what to do with his hands but make fists of them. "...We weren't doing anything bad. I wouldn't let us."

"Intent doesn't matter, Lin," the eidolon replied, placing a hand on the boy's shoulder. "Come now. Set better examples, for yourself and your friends. You're a child, not a *fool*."

Linnie shoved the paw off his shoulder. “I’m not a child anymore. I’m *twelve*!” The prince bit his lip, uncomfortable with pushing the conversation further. “...I can... choose where I go.”

Ildy knelt down to the lad. “I know you might feel that way, Lin, but it's still important you stay safe. For your mother and father, and for me. I can cover for you for them, but *you*-- you need to be careful.”

The prince averted his gaze from the eidolon. “Careful how, Ildy? I’m always careful around people. And more than that, people are always careful around me.”

“I suppose the present company is excluded?” Ildy made a gallant gesture towards Aster, who blushed and sank into himself.

“That’s not the same--!” Linnie protested loudly. “Ildy, you don’t have to be like mom and dad.”

“I don’t try to be,” the brightly-colored eidolon knelt down towards the child. "I’m not your parent, lad. You know that, well as I do. But I am your caretaker. I am charged with you. More than keeping ourselves responsible, I *am* family, and I share their concerns. Your ability to get into your own trouble notwithstanding, its in both our interests to keep each other safe. That's why there are systems in place.”

Linnie huffed. "I know…"

The eidolon gave a tempered smile. "Believe it or not, I went through an adolescent period too. Rebellious, like yourself. Wanting to break free."

Slightly baffled, Linnaeus reevaluated the charming magical creature before him. “Didn’t the gods make you... I guess... fully formed?”

"Oh, it wasn’t like you,” Ildy went on. “When your duke-father upheld the [[Ban of Ignoble Conduct|edict against adventurers]], there was all kinds of youthful rage throughout his domain against that. Even I found his arguments quite... *degrading*." If a drake could bite its lip, Ildy was trying to. "A group of people, a *team* -- their weaponry and minds united against common enemies of the state, all standing together on a quest of…" It hand opened, releasing the tension.. "...growth."

Ildy’s eyes seemed to get lost in a sense of national pride. There was a story untold in that reliving of the glory.

"The nobility had an issue with their, shall we say, autonomy. Having to stand versus lord and crown granted them with a certain call to action.

"As you well know, Critical Hit eventually embarked on an outlaw’s quest, and ended up changing the course of this country. To decry any of that seems a folly these days. But there was an era, not long ago, where it wasn’t the norm. It changed."

Young master Linnaeus wasn’t sure whether he'd been told anything so clinically in all his life.  He tried to make heads or tails of it. "And so I should...? Rebel? Because it changes things?"

"Er. Well." At that, Ildy was dumbstruck. "...No," the eidolon assured its listener. "No, the point was that I understand where you're coming from, ultimately, lad. The Ban of Ignoble Conduct -- that only served the interests of greedy individuals and what have you, far from those who had our nation's best interests at heart. But, and this is important -- the system we have, as friends, is to keep us safe, right? It's in the *nation's* interest to keep you safe."

Linnie glanced back at Aster and Lylian. The two of them were giggling to themselves over something: probably about coming back here later. They'd almost entirely forgotten whatever undue gravity Ildy had placed on their immature actions. 

"Do they..." Lin stammered. "We're not being unsafe, we're... we should be in charge... Does having fun with my friends have to come at the cost of my safety?"

"It doesn't, lad. See? You don't need to change the system for that. All we're asking for -- your father, mother, and I -- is that I check in with you once in the morning and once at night. Between that, just..." it gave a slight chuckle. "Just make sure you're following the rules."

A shield, of immaculate shape and size, coated in a sigil of orange and blue steel, suddenly leapt from nothing into Ildy's hand with a shimmering sound. Ildy called it the '*Drastic Measure*'. 

"Here, let's... just take care of it. For putting your heart at ease, if not mine," the eidolon spoke, almost embarassed that it felt the need to ask.

Ildy extended its free paw, and Lin sheepishly took it in both hands, while the shield-arm came to embrace the prince in a hug. 

A fraction of a second later, there was a small ripple in psychospace, which passed from the shield to its bearer to Lin almost instantaneously. An orangeish light, the color of Ildy's starry eyes, flickered over Linnaeus.

National pride -- the psychic links between the everyone on this side of the cold pale spires of Saurus Castle, and the *everyone* on the other side of it -- coursed into the barrier, around the heir to the throne. It tickled across his entire body all at once, his nerves jolted awake by the feeling of... *warmth*. [[Fire]], maybe.

Same ritual. Every day as far as his memory recalled. And from the sounds of things, every day for the rest of Lin's young life. 

The young Linnaeus gingerly released the paw, his heart still unrestful.

"You know, I have friends other than you," Linnie's indignant voice dropped to a quiet whisper, as though about to speak a swear word. "This... this isn't about the curse, is it? About protecting them from...?" He didn't finish.

A darkness passed over Ildy's face, before a sanitized grin replaced it. 

"It's about you, lad. *All of this* is to protect you."

***

She arrived, right on cue. 

She had accepted his silent invitation. Under her weight the stairs made almost no sound, her paws stepping lithely down as the clock on the wall neared highmoon. 

[[Star of the North]] was wearing a purple sleep-dress from among her belongings, surely something she’d gathered from [[Archipel]]. The gown was like a walking blanket, keeping her own snowy-gray fur warm in the frigid wilderness or on the high waterseas of her native land. It must be positively sweltering to wear inside a tavern on this side of the Heavens, even after-hours on a [[Month (unit)|Gewalt]] night such as this. 

The catfolk girl, this holy champion, who’d fallen clean of the sky in the name of justice... she cared. And only the gods could really understand why the two had taken off so. It was all so very poetic, and yet these were the kinds of things Linnaeus knew must be fate. He had gravitated to these companions of an escort group already, and now, the gods answered with someone he knew could bear the weight of his burden. 

Prince Linnaeus, a survivor of his own judgment day, stared into the empty glass, stared at the ice floating in its own melt. The scars on his back began to ache under his nightshirt, as though it knew what he was about to say. What he was about to do. Fate frustrated him as much as it rewarded him. 

He would divest himself of all doubt.

*I won’t feel alone. I will not bear this alone. Not for one more second.*

He reached down to below the bar, picked up the scabbard, and laid it on his lap, wiping the tears from his eyes with his other hand. For just another moment more, he shut his eyes and felt, immeasurably, at peace, the faintest ringing of the ruby-talon sword within stilling his disquieted heart.

“You asked for me?” The tabaxi stood a few feet away. She had never seen him look quite so troubled, quite so unready, and glanced aside at the still-full glass next to an empty one.

He indicated the seat next to his. “Please,” he muttered, a formality.

The paladin sat beside him, reaching out and taking the glass while almost side-eyeing her companion. 

“What’s going on? You don’t *get* like this,” Star casually determined, gesturing at the display before her. “I don't know you as well as some must, but I don’t know you to be this kind of way. ...Are you feeling well?”

Lin breathed in through his nose and out through bared teeth, a bout of inner frost not enough to staunch his confidence. In one hand, he took up the scabbard by the blade, and held the handle of [[Dinofang]] out towards Star. 

The tabaxi did not know how to react, at first, other than to begin to drink what had been poured for her. “Swear… swear on this,” the prince slowly declared. “Swear not to speak of tonight to anyone, please. Not even Ildy.”

Star informally reached over and grasped the outstretched handle of Dinofang, setting down her glass with her other hand. "Linnaeus, I swear. You are allowed to have *bad days*, liege."

But the prince needed more than verbal assurance. More than the blood oath. "Draw the sword from her scabbard," Linnaeus pleaded. "Please. Prove your loyalty, your worthiness."

“Is this…” asked Star, slightly bewildered at the prince's sudden lack of trust. “Do you not have my word on all things between us, liege?” 

“*Swear it*,” he pleaded, then took a sharp breath. “Your honor is not in question, Star. This is just… for my sake. For *our* sakes.”

Unsure and unclear, Star appeared genuinely worried, as though afraid she’d touched a nerve. Then she brought her fuzzy paws, both of them, to the blade’s grip. “You have my word. Of course. But, Prince," Star protested. "Is it necessary to swear over a sword the secret that... well, a *prince*, world on his shoulders, sometimes has a bit of a dour night? You have my oath and... for thy record, you don't seem to be in that bad of sorts."

"It is not just a *night* I am having, Star," the prince uttered carefully, his tone serious. "I need to prove you are sincere before I can tell you what is going on, inside my mind. *She* needs you to be sincere."

The crimson gem blade, as sharp as the glassy talon it was made from, rang with a shimmering sound as it was pulled free of the plain leather scabbard. A barrage of lightning flashed outside.

Held gingerly in the tabaxi’s hands, the longblade of Dinofang seemed as weightless as a dagger: her components felt impeccably balanced, and her edge was vorpally sharpened. The two gazed at their faces through the red refractive, translucent fang that glimmered in the dim light of the tavern.

The moment was almost palpable, but Star's worthiness aside, Linnaeus breathed a sigh of some relief.

"It's a nice sword," the tabaxi commented. "I swear over it I will not speak of tonight."

"She trusts you," said Linnaeus. "So I do, too. If she did not, you would not be wielding her."

Star returned the blade to the prince's hands, where it felt as though it were too much to bear. Mustering all his will, he managed to return the blade to its sheath. When he glanced back up, Star was not looking at her drink at all. She was looking at him, at the tears rolling down his face.

"Linnie," she muttered, afraid to ask. "Tell me what you need to tell me, please."

His eyes locked with hers.

“...Something inside me has been dying for a long, long time. It’s been there since before I was born." The words came without much thought. "And... and... it has eaten away at me."

---

"Eaten away?" Aster mumbled. "Looks pretty alive to me."

The prince raised a gloved hand to the rust on what could be seen of the gate. Black paint flecked off onto his fingertips, rain slicking the dark brown metal. An arborous network ran over every inch of the iron fence, smothering it beneath scarlet blossoms, reified in their purity. Sweet red-bombs lined the path, drowned in the ditch, by the dozen. There must've been hundreds in both directions.

Over the childrens' heads, a latticed limb of root, branch, and stem held a spear of gnarled iron aloft in mock pride, the rest of the fencepost left tarnished and rain-damaged by the side of the road. The frogs were just about the only sound around, save the muffled beat of the city some kilometers away, and the storm occasionally booming overhead. 

"The [[bloodberry]] patch is *wild* now, not dying," observed Linnie, taking a shard of graphite from a side-satchel and making a rough illustration in his journal. "See? In most other ecosystems, the patch would parch most of its direct competitors. It's a desert species, why it's a 'loner' in a garden. But now, these bloodberries are drinking up the water that the animals *can't*. The rusty water from the ditch, before it gets into the dirt." 

"It's... doing that on purpose?" The page bit his lip in mild disgust. The red, thorny vines dripped with dark-red sap, like they were the exposed arteries of some ginormous creature.

Linn turned to his companion as he stowed the journal. "Somehow, it's a chaotic symbiosis. It's eating away at the post. Storing rainwater inside itself, then 'bleeding' to rust the post even more. That's why it doesn't poison the groundwater."

Aster whistled. "And why it's way bigger than the garden it was planted in, now. *Uxaat.*" 

The page brought forth, as though from his pocket, a small handful of white flame in his palm. The sacred fire cleared away some of the roots, which had engulfed a metal placard -- a terribly-illegible placard reading, *Gar-en of B-ll-on - Bou-ties Dona-ed  -y Gr-ce of [[Gurvig Ursyna|G-rvi-g -rsyna]]*. 

"This is the place?"

"Looks like it," the prince observed the broken-down gate, a hole in the endless system of [[blood-flora]]. "Try not to step on too many reddies. Or into too many *potholes*." 

The boys passed through the threshold of the garden. Occasionally, one of them would step on a bloodberry accidentally, and it would SNAP open, spraying the ground around it with crimson-purple syrup, laced with seeds.

The dejected Royal Hunting Gardens were where Linnaeus went to escape: just far enough from home that he'd escape the notice of his family, just close enough that he could make the distance back before anyone noticed he was gone.

"Remind me--" Aster began, ducking a low bough of a tree. "How did you find this spot again?"

"Walks," Linnie mumbled, plainly. "I go on walks, with Ildy, sometimes. Through here."

"*With Ildy*," repeated Aster. "And are you regularly scouting for places to camp? On walks? Without us?"

"No, I just... I knew this would be a good spot to get away for just a little bit." A raindrop fell directly on top of Linnaeus's head. "Well, at least if this weather passes, it will be."

The sorcerer-page ten paces behind the prince kicked a red-bomb with the side of their foot. A squirrel-shaped shadow emerged from the low mist and stole it before it even bumped against a tree. Snapping it up for all it's worth.

"You know I'm down for anything, Lin," Aster mumbled aloud, stopping in their tracks. "I guess... I'm a little afraid of the lie-game we're playing. I'm all for camping, y'know. But, is there... a reason we're doing this today?"

Linnaeus turned, searching for the words of explanation he'd hoped wouldn't have to cross his lips.

"You remember a few days ago, right? When we got caught? Ildy... I mean, he cares about me, I care about him, I *love* him like anyone in my family. But... he really does treat all of us -- me, you, Lylian, Varri -- like we're stupid kids that can't do anything for ourselves."

"We could try following procedure more," said Aster, glancing aside, smirking.

"*Or* we can just... cut loose a bit. Prove it to mom and dad that we're not stupid. We're just gonna... spend some time to ourselves," Linnaeus affirmed. "We're not even gonna be gone that long. We'll be back before sunrise tomorrow."

"Okay, I'm game... but... why today?"

"Because *I'm not going to get it out of my system* otherwise," said Linnie, turning back to face the front. "Now come on, it's not much farther. Let's have fun."

The hike proceeded. The trees which lined the path continued to bend into stranger and stranger shapes. The air was dense with rain, exactly to set the proper dour mood that Linnie was trying to hide from Aster. Occasionally, they'd pass over a brook leading out towards the sea, and the wind would change.

The boys continued along this trail through the gardens for some time, until descending a steady hill and emerging into a small, but quickly darkening, clearing. The storm had faded in intensity, and all that was left was an eerie mist o'er a dense thicket of the woods.

Perhaps it was a trick of the evening light, perhaps not, but Aster quite clearly saw the shape of something shifting silently about in the darkness, barely making footfall. 

The soaring wind became faint, and was replaced with a clattering noise, like a tapestry of reeds hung from a windowsill. 

And then, Aster became more and more sure of the reality of the pair of glinting red lights that danced about in the shadow, that danced closer and closer.

“Linn," the page quietly urged. "Something, on your left.”

The young prince tarried on, his human eyes barely accustomed to the dark. “Why does *everyone* think I don't know how to--”

A flash of silver in the dark was spotted just in time, and Linnaeus’s shoulder was suddenly yanked back, clear of the knife which suddenly tore across the space. 

The prince and his companion yelped in unison -- Linnaeus out of surprise, and Aster out of wincing pain. Blue blood dripped across the ground to fill the space between it and a suspended sword. 

Something stumbled out of the darkened garden. Whatever it was, its aura seemed to fill the air with a stench, like it was in disagreement with what surrounded it. With what surrounded the boys. The darkness swaying unsteadily forward was shaped like a man, modeled on one, but made up of a blur of white stained with red. Its teeth chittered and its body clambered forward, its existence hollow, restless, weightless. The only implement which distinguished it from the nature around it was a heavy, rusted wrought-iron blade, clutched in dead, ivory fingers.

The prydite-yarn had split along Aster's casting glove, exposing pale flesh and splitting the tendon of their thumb wide open. The thin blue threads of arcane-conductive material were soaked in cobalt. 

"*Puuka!*" Aster swore, screaming in pain, in Diabolic. The word itself resonated across Dinofang's edge. 

On adrenaline alone the prince instinctively placed his right hand over his left, white-knuckling the red sword with both arms, and stood in front of his companion. The darkened skeleton bore down towards him, chattering its teeth as though uttering a sinister laugh.

Linnie didn't know why there were skeletons in the royal grounds. He wanted to ask it why it was here. He wanted to shout something cool, something brave, like *Take your best shot!* But his body locked up, his tongue held. If he spoke, he'd be too afraid to fight. *Save your courage for your body,* his inner swordmaster instructed. 

His eyes could barely see the shape as it moved to lunge at him again. His heartbeat caught up to him.

*Clang!* Just in time, Linnaeus saw it in the crimson light, moved his hands, and his blade stopped the attack from sinking into him. The weight of the enemy's sword slammed itself against the prince. His opponent was taller, stronger. This was no training dummy.

Its eye-sockets ran with overgrowth, vines dwindling in its skull, and its mouth clattered open, seething. What sounded like a faded word whispered forth from its jaws, and the blade pressed even heavier against the prince.

<span class=horus>*BOY... KING...*</span> 

It was recognition in a language which nothing in this battle understood. It was no language at all; these were the echoes that made up this un-creature, resonating as a temporary shared thought.

Linnie held his own, held his breath. Tension, nervousness, built in his legs, but the manuever came together in his mind. With his arms still bound in blade-lock, sparks scattering across the leaves, he anchored a forward leg in the dirt, and the other became a swift kick to the underside of its opponent.

The undead's balance tumbled apart, Linnaeus's arms flying forward. The rusted weapon of his opponent went flying back, going horizontal to the floor along with its carrier. The left shin-bone had snapped off, and the miasma of void energy around the opposing force seemed to lessen just that little bit.  As Linn's body followed through, he exhaled, shouting an unsteady *kiai*. His arms resumed feeling, and one went immediately towards his ally, whimpering nearby him.

"Aster, don't move," the prince just managed to speak, through grit teeth. His blood surged with white and silver, his body filled with warmth, warmth that passed from Linn to Aster. "*Alato*," came the command word, the one that set that warmth in action. 

The bleeding slowed, the wound stitching together with imparted golden light. Healing magic only made Aster yelp more. "My mom made me these gloves special," they shouted expletives at the heap of bones. "Agh, *Nexos take you!*"

Undistracted by the exchange of vitality, or by the invocation of the judge of the dead, the undead swordsman tore its attention away from the prince towards reattaching what bits of itself had broken off in the martial attack on its dignity. It was distracted. Off-guard, and unprepared for what the frustration of the sorcerer had wrought.

"*U-Uxaata!*" 

Aster thrust his good hand forward, encanted the spell-word, and guided the energy from his source into the tips of his fingers. 

Light sparked from the prydite fabric, and a band of white, holy fire coursed across the open space, setting fading spores alight on their way to the halves-of-skeleton left on the floor. Those embers formed a focused circlet of flame, but its more mobile upper-half managed to evade the attack only just. 

The lower limbs of the skeleton, meanwhile, were further broken into component bones, tendons severed and scattered. The necromantic magic was faltering seam-by-seam: the stuff of life reminded them that their motivity was false.

The skeleton's upper half seemed to glance at its splayed legs mournfully, slowly... before then lashing its blade like a manic, frustrated claw towards the two boys. Both of them screamed in panic. How do you deflect a raging, wild animal with a sword? It was a problem the boys had mere moments to solve.

Linnie blindly cut across the air, hoping that the legendary blade might have something useful to do to protect them. Sure enough, the perfect edge of Dinofang tore a vacuum open, a cut which shook the air apart between the boy and the bones. 

This vibration turned into a wave of thunderous energy which rocketed towards the skeleton, faster than the eye could track. It caught all three of the panicked fighters off-guard. The attack sounded like the tumbling of rocks down a cliffside, and it caught the skeleton's blade on the edge, mid-swing: reversed its momentum. 

The rusted sword banged flat against the undead's shoulder, knocked the joint loose, enough that its next attack was slowed down: predictable enough for Linnie to block it horizontally, parrying it with the hilt, off to the side.

When it came back around, so the skeleton could make its own pass across its opponent's limbs — so tenacious it was that attempting to disarm it meant nothing — Linnaeus brought one boot down onto the hand carrying the blade. The timing was perfect, and Linnaeus heard its fingers uncomfortably CRUNCH under his weight. It was stylish. They had this thing at their mercy. 

Except, with its blade trapped, the writhing bones lunged its remaining hand for the leg holding it there.

A searing pain roared up the prince's body. His nerves were shot in a moment. The skeleton was as frustrated as it ever was, digging the tips of its bony joints into the young prince. Crimson blood started to seep through his clothes. 

The skull turned towards him almost pleadingly, as though it were a dog whose tail had been stepped on. It was angry, writhing, begging him to let go. The red blips which dwelled inside gazed quizzically at Linnie. <span class=horus>*NOT HE... GOOD BLOOD...*</span> it determined, apparently frustrated with this notion.

Wincing something fierce, Linnaeus raised Dinofang and attacked towards the face. He no longer could visualize what the attack would look like or should be: his eyes were shut. He just wanted out, out of this pain. Kill the thing in front of him. *Kill*, his mind told him. *Stop it from hurting me.*

*SHINK.* The blade split bone. Linnaeus's arms were fixed in place, and the skeleton's hand buried in his leg scraped for traction. The whole room seemed to spin, the pain even deeper than it had been before. Linnie tried to yank back, pull his sword free, but... *oh gods*, it was getting harder and harder to stand.

Aster shouted something, though Linnie was on the verge of blacking out. The prince's hands were still tightly around Dinofang, when a flash of blurry, warm light caused whatever the sword was stuck in to melt into fragments, caused the sword to clang to the floor, free from the skull it had stabbed through.

*Noted for later, undead don't have pain receptors,* Linnie's mind faintly parsed.

Linnie tumbled onto his ass, onto the dirt. Everything seemed quiet. A bony hand was still wrapped around his thigh. It took everything not to vomit from the injury, which had been such a shock to his system in part because he was scarcely prepared for it. The dirt was soft, but it felt like needles through the tears carved out of his leg.

Something blurry that looked like Aster was kneeling over him. Surveying the wound.

"This is a gods-damned *lousi* you've led me into," Aster was saying, digging through their travel pack for salve. Returning the favor. “What the hell are undead doing out here? Holiest city on the face of Sacred my-- ” The sorcerer shook his hand out, seething with pain. "*Mother Tía*, this smarts… H-How are you doing, Linnie?"

"I've b-been worse," the prince outright lied. "Could use... something." He limply gestured to the deep cuts across his thigh that were making the world dizzy, preventing the bravest boy in all of Sacred from getting to his feet.

"We shouldn't be here, Linnie," responded Aster immediately. "We should just cut our losses, get out of here. Go home. Nice warm bed. Some medical attention? All that *puuha*. Sounds reeeeal nice about now."

"Don't be a downer, AC... And anyway, if we d-do that," Linnie said, feeling cold. "Then all this would be pointless. We're smart. We're not *kids*. We're not *little bitches*. We're not... g-gonna prove their point. Let's keep pushing."

"This is stupid, Lin." Aster's hand clipped something in their pack, and they winced — hard — from the pain of the thumb they were busy wrapping with bandages. "We may not be little bitches, but after getting a cut like that, I sure feel like one."

"You're not," Linn breathed through his teeth while the wound was wrapped and pressed. "Trust me… We're not. We're... we got caught off-guard."

“Yeah, I'll say, angel-boy. Thing nearly took your head off.”

Linn nodded, the face suddenly darkening as they realize how right that was. “I owe you my life. You're going to make a great royal guard some day. Thank you.”

Aster pressed the wound, looked in the prince's eyes with the same pleading as the vacuous skull -- stuck as an image in his head. “Can you thank me by getting us the hell out of here?”

The prince unfortunately shook his head, smiling weakly.

The page huffed, but nodded back. "After this, this camping spot better be the best place either of us've ever slept. Or you owe me a platinum."

Time lazily passed, and [[starfall]] soon came. As the boys dressed their wounds, the clearing grew yet darker and more sinister than before. The dancing lights Aster called forth from their source-point helped, but more to add to the atmosphere of the hunting garden than to illuminate the vicinity.

After some time, Linnie was able to stand on the injured leg. Something occurred to him as he did so. 

The sorcerer noticed this curious expression. "What is it?"

The prince gestured towards... the remains of their unlikely adversary, illuminated in the pale magelight. 

"What do we do with it?"

Aster muttered their question back at them, nudging the skull with their foot. "I dunno. It's just a skeleton. It was movin' around, now it's not."

"I *mean*... I feel bad just leaving a skeleton lying around," Linnie admitted. "Even in bits. We... we don't even know who this was."

"Who th--" It hadn't even really occurred to Aster that this skeleton *used to be* somebody at all. "I mean, do... do we have to know?"

"I guess not," Linnie mumbled. "It's just... disquieting. Didn't that skeleton seem... small... to you? I thought most dead people were... older."

It was true what the prince was observing. The skull and proportions of the body were almost uncannily similar to the people it had attacked. The weapon was oversized in the creature's hand... And the words it said... *boy-king...*

Aster didn't want to spare this another thought. "I mean, they attacked us. We killed them. Er... I guess we *re-*killed them. So we're fine. And the sword's rusty -- whoever this was died and came back long before we were here."

After a moment, Linnaeus shrugged. "You're right. It shouldn't bug me."

*But it does*, Linnie thought, and Aster knew.

"That was... a lot. Let's get out of here," the sorcerer affirmed, drawing a magelight towards the path's exit.  "We're already tired, so getting some shut-eye ought to be easy once we set up... wherever it is we're going."

Linnaeus eyed the ground nervously, as though expecting something else dead to erupt from it. "We... should turn back. It's already nightfall."

Aster looked frustrated. "Hey, now. *First he says one thing, now he says...*" They sighed. "I'm good to keep going..." 

What stopped him was the blood coating Linnie's hand. It wasn't from his leg. It was from his nose.

"Man," mumbled Aster. "What's going on with you? You gonna pass out on me?"

"No, no. I'm just... I'm so sorry for hyping this camping trip up all day. It... we can do this safely, some other time," Linnaeus managed, sniffling and coughing again. "Sorry, I... I don't know how to answer what's going on with me."

*Aster didn't deserve to get hurt for my stupid shit. Stupid. Come on. Shit... lot of blood, coming out of my face. Lot of* black *blood.*

"It's cool, Linnie. We got magelight, we got ourselves, let's get home. I'm sorry we couldn't spend the night. H-hey, maybe we can ask someone back home to tell us who that was who attacked us."

And then came the prince's *correct* response, all-too-quickly after that. His mouth fell open. 

*Oh no, the ritual. The daily routine. Oh, I didn't plan this out at all... Ildy... Ildy... oh gods... Hopefully nothing happens...*

"Claudius," the prince said, suddenly sick to his stomach. "Oh, hells, man. We gotta get moving, *now*. Or something bad will happen."

Aster was frozen-solid, staring straight at the prince. As though they still believed he was a minute out from passing out.

"What? *What, dude?* Why are you looking at me?" His voice was already changing. Doubling. Deepening.

The sorcerer pointed with some alarm to the area just over Linnaeus's head. Couldn't find the words. "Linnie... what... *the hell is happening*?!"

"What do you m--"

There was suddenly the feeling of fire all over him. Linnaeus doubled over, weight pressing its name into his flesh. His back felt as though something massive was crawling all over it, sending chills down his spine. No, it wasn't something with legs: it was like a massive flail, tied into knots: tearing his back to shreds, whirling and carving.

Some creature, a ghost or something, had crawled its way into their camp, and was destroying Linnie, sending him to the ground again. He reached impotently for Dinofang. But it was too far... *nowhere to go...*

"ASTER!" The prince yelled, anything to give his friend some confidence. Linnie was scraping his face with his hands. "KILL IT! WHATEVER IT IS! *PLEASE!*"

"What?!" Aster was looking at a whole different picture. It was inexplicable. Awesome. Awful. "Linn, what's happening to you--?!"

Linnie wanted to scream back, but... Couldn't. His body was locking up. It was painful to move, and it was painful to not move. His breathing became unsteady. An energy coursed through him, wracked his experience of reality, started pouring out of his mind and his mouth. The energy came in waves and bolts; it sent Aster sprawling, but neither of them could tell clearly what was happening. 

Linnie didn't want whatever the hell was happening to hurt his friend. His mind felt like a spear was being pressed through it... or coming out of it. 



Through blind eyes, wincing pain, he saw the gaps in his own fate. A flash of a time to come, *if* he was lucky. A power that awakened inside him. 

A flash of figures upon figures. He felt unpeeled, unraveling. His soul was out of alignment. One brandished a broken, melted blade, a scorched companion the shape of a vortex. One brandished the sword that had fallen tip-down in the sand, waited for their chance. And Lin themself looked down and saw... 

...another them. The *un*-them. The not-them. And yet more in the blade held to a throat that was their own. 

*...I was not singular,* the prince scarcely thought. *Am I... not a man? That's... insane. Who else am I supposed to be?*
<nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br>
<span class="horus">***~~YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ME.<br> YOU ARE A PIECE OF ME,~~***</span><br> answered [[Arahabaki|something that both was and wasn't]].
<nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br>

And in this flash, this vision that was more than what he saw, the darkness was being taken from him. 

Taken *out*. Ripped open. Life was filling in the gaps. Life from where? Didn't matter. He was, without exaggeration, more alive than he ever had been. 

And now it was... here. It was now. Something coming from within him. The darkness. The life. The life inside the darkness, inside Linnaeus. It was turning him alive. Waking his every being up. All of him writhing. All of him scared.

*That darkness smelled Aster's blood... wanted a taste.*

"*Holy shit*, Linnie," Aster was shouting, vaguely, at the seizing shape of his best friend, rolling on the forest floor. "Are you okay?! Uh.. uh... shit... Do you-- do you need me to get Ildy?" He turned to the sky. "HELP! ANYONE!"

The cold in his soul was unimaginable. The pain like being encased in a block of ice. Every sensation kept his heart beating, and yet he wanted to see the floor rise up to meet him. In this moment, he panicked. Sleep was not an option. Control was not an option.



<nbr><br><nbr><br>
"*...Linnaeus?!*" 

Aster sounded alarmed, but with a hint of repulsion and disbelief. Like they didn't recognize who it was they were looking at. 

They called the prince's name, again and again. Raised a hand defensively. Deaf. Deaf ears. Aster's voice faded out.

And alone inside this piercing, shrieking noise, Linnaeus willed his body to scream. Didn't think of anything else to do. Screamed into the night. Screamed inside his head if he had to. His body continued to change. His spine burned, his nerves lit up. It was tormentous. Endless. Spiraling.

His eyes fixed on the boy in front of him. His body wasn't his anymore...

Help. Help me. Screaming quietly. Hoping someone would hear. Sounded like the boy was on fire, which he might have been, for all he knew.

The night wouldn't listen. It wasn't quiet. Aster was screaming, too. Screaming into Linnie's ears. 

<nbr><br><nbr><br>~~Stopped screaming at some point.~~

<nbr><br>
<nbr><br><nbr><br>
And then, slowly, but surely, Linnaeus found himself out of energy. He had done it. Defeated the moment. His eyelids fluttered, his body grew heavy and tired. Yet his mind lingered. He wanted to go home. 

He wanted to undo this. To wake up from the bad dream. This wasn't real. The curse wasn't real. A mantra, spoken into being. This wasn't real danger.

He just wanted to be fixed. He wanted Ildy to work his magic and make everything better. To run its fingers through his hair and say, *"That's a good lad."*

But he could not. There wouldn't be a happy ending.

Void enveloped him like a blanket.

<nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br>
<nbr><br>
*No. No, please.* 

Linnaeus's lungs were empty. He was gasping for air. Gasping. Not getting enough. Lungs? Punctured? Maybe. Hoped not. Disbelief. Praying. Very little soul left.

Linnaeus wasn't broken. He wasn't wrong. He was just a stupid kid. Just a normal, stupid kid. He didn't know any better. Let bygones be bygones. He was a prince, he doesn't go out like this. This was infuriating. This was dire. 

*Move something. Breathe. I don't know what to do. SHOW ME YOU'RE IN THERE.* 

***Get up, kid. GET UP.*** 

<nbr><br><nbr><br>
<nbr><br>

And he realized, he wasn't *just* speaking to himself. He was talking to the royal page on the floor. A torn page. Barely in a single piece. The details blurred in and out. Thick blood painted the rocks. Most of it was Linnie's, he thought. A dim expression cast on the boy on the ground's face. He'd hoped. Still warm. Steaming.

*What... what did this... what...*

~~Gods-alive. Gods-alive, get me out. I was so wrong.~~

Ildy, I'm sorry. Ildy, I'm so sorry. These were the only things he could think, in his fading moments. The last thing he could give voice to. I was wrong to be careless. I was wrong to run. I knew what you said was right. 

<br><nbr><br>

If you'll just come back, everything will be okay.

The nightmare will end.

<br><nbr><br>

Right?
<nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr><br>


 Linnie pleaded to anybody who could hear him passing out. And his voice echoed, to nobody at all,



<br><nbr><br><nbr><br><nbr>

Aster Claudius, c'mon. Wake up.

Aster, please. PLEASE.

I don't want to die.

I don't want to die.

Don't let me die. Don't let us die.

...

"You stopped telling the story," the tabaxi said, her arms wrapped around him. 

Lin hadn't even seen her do that, too caught up in the pain of something he'd pushed down for so long. He wasn't even fully conscious of the fact that he had been crying for a full minute before she spoke.

"It's okay," reassured Star. "You don't have to keep going." *I got the picture,* she restrained herself from saying.

Even with her saying so, the prince regained enough composure to calmly state, "At that moment…. *It* was awake."

"...*It*?"

The prince's voice fell to a whisper. He really *was* about to do this. 

"*It* is why I must always travel with Ildy. It is why I cannot sleep at night. It is why being in the cathedral today, with Werwin, was a pain I could not describe."

Almost afraid to ask, Star pressed on. "What could have hurt you this way?"

"*It*... is [[Dragonic Curse|a curse]]," the prince defiantly confided. "*The* curse, on my family. A dispassionate curse that wants to turn me... turn me inside out."

"A curse, Lin?" In response, the catfolk leaned back, repeating the prince's words in order to make sure she understood the shape of them. "What do you mean? Does it yearn to kill you?"

"It wishes to use me." Linnaeus shook his head solemnly. "Use me, to kill everyone else."

Star of the North lightly gasped.

"We don't know even really know where it came from. But it's claimed rulers of this Kingdom, time and time again. The last person who had it had to be *killed*—" —the prince tightly squeezed the blade's handle— "—when they were just *18*. Every day since I've become an.. adult, I've thought... it could *strike*." He gathered his breath. "That's every day for the past two years."

The tabaxi had noticed, in the short time she'd been with the [[S4|Royal Escort Group]], that unspoken anxiety that coated Linnaeus's every act. This talk... this *confession*, was starting to give that anxiety a shape *and* a name.

"This curse, it's an old picture in a broken frame, behind scorched glass, lodged in my skull. We lock it down, push my eyes away. But I feel it there. Even now.”

*Drip. Drip. Drip…*

“I fear every day that the seal will slip… If it were not for Ildy, I would already look half-dragon by now. Worse, I may have… I might succumb one day. I don’t… I don’t want to be that. I don’t want to be anyone aside from me. I don't..."
<br><nbr><br><br><nbr><br>
What may have, in that moment, felt harder to grasp than the depths of the pact he’d just made... was the recollection of a grisly detail, which stilled his tongue.

The curse had not claimed him… had scarcely touched him. But in fact, it *had* done so. Perhaps he had been too young to face the profundity of it all, the torturous abyss of memory, waking up in his bed with no clear picture of the night previous. 

No, he simply hadn't wanted to believe it. Inside the depths of his mind had, in fact, been a clearer picture of his eternal adversary than he thought existed. 

It, whoever it might've once been, whoever it wanted to be, was alive inside a *feeling*. And it wanted that feeling to consume everything.
<br><nbr><br><br><nbr><br>
In that same medical bay, across from Aster, whose healed mind had been altered, too: spared of the harrowing details of the morning that Linnaeus had broken the only rule that mattered. The prince knew now far better than to trust his immature instincts at the time.

In this moment, in making this accord, the prince vividly recalled the taste of his friend's warm, tangy blood. 

The light faded from Aster's eyes. Was brought back, but... died, then, in Linnie's arms... *to Linnie's teeth.*

*The first of many*, the memory promised. These delirious, hateful thoughts were not his own, but they were indistinct from anything he could recall of that day.

<span class="horus">Beyond all doubt, the prince remembered that he enjoyed the taste.</span>
<br><nbr><br><br><nbr><br>
The thoughts washed over him like a freakish passion. And he was... *speaking them* aloud.



“*I don’t want anyone else to die… I don’t want to become this,*” the weeping prince pleaded, his eyes shut, trying to force the thoughts out of his body: out his mind, out his mouth. “Every day, with this curse, I have the same waking nightmares. Every day, I am scared of becoming this hate that dwells inside me."

Star’s words did not know where Linnie’s had stopped, but she knew, sure as sun, as she glared down at the red, glimmering cross shape burned and carved into the young prince’s back. Even his shirt seemed to recoil at them. She ran her fingers along it, tracing the symbol of scales, the heat under her paws like touching fire, the unreal merger between boy and dragon.

The prince was scarred by the form of ungodly wings...

...trying to *sprout*.

"But when I’m with you," he continued, almost proposing. "I don’t feel like I have to be afraid, anymore. You can protect me. I *know* you can protect me. I believe in us. *I don’t want to be a monster*."

And her arms came to surround his. The warmth of Star's fur was almost like insulation against the aching chills that wracked Linnie's body. Chills against a fire within. Warmth on frost on warmth.  A friend. A *true* friend.

The prince's hands raised to hers. He didn't stop crying. Even telling the story was a lot. He was... a creature of pure regret. For surviving this. For feeling every so often that he didn't deserve to survive this. For feeling that this was all pointless. That he'd end up a head on a royal table, soon enough...

Although it would’ve been impossible for her to recognize the wound by sight, still, Star seemed to understand. Seemed to want to understand, at the least.

"I got you," the paladin said, and it was true. "I got you. We all got you. We'll all be there for you."

"I would scarcely want to ask that..." Linnaeus heard himself start.

"Hey," Star affirmed. "It'll be okay. Your life... it won't end tonight. Everything will be okay. Ground yourself, liege."

The prince gasped lightly. Something auspicious out of the corner of his eye. "Ground... myself..."

Star turned his eyes to match hers. "Just... find something to hold onto. I can keep this secret. You've done a lot just telling me it. I won't let this... curse... come to get you. I won't let it turn you against yourself. *None of us will.* And if it tries, we'll help you shut it down."

Linnaeus was glancing at a lightning bolt, through a window over Star's shoulder, which seemed to be slowly flickering across the horizon.

"Are you gonna be okay?" Star asked, almost knowing the Prince's response. "We'll protect you, Linnie. All of us will protect you. Okay? Take a breath. Count on us."

*All of this is to protect you.*

Two weeks from now, he would be in unimaginable pain. No more companions. No more safety. Sequestered. Star takes up his sword. Takes up his cause. Two months from then, their friends would find the secret, what nobody else could. And a month later, everyone upstairs at the Clear Skies Tavern... would be *safe*. 

Years passing in his mind. What was made was unmade was made again. But Linnie would be alive at the end of it. These thoughts flooded through his mind. From the future. From the past. From all at once.

But the moment, the exact moment he was in... it felt true. It felt good. It felt... freeing, like chains had been broken. Because of tonight.

Through it, the prince smiled a genuine smile, for the first time in a long time. 

It was the sprouting of something new.
