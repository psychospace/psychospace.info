**Bullion** is a [[remnant]] in the southwestern [[Mer de Vide]], a neighbor to [[Archipel]]. The milieux of cultures, wildlife, and trade networks which pass through Bullion represent a predominant power in modern day, particularly through its ruling body, [[The Shibboleth]]. 

Ecologically, owing to its history, Bullion has a unique affectation of the powers of nature, which make its diverse biomes all the more magical. It earns its name from the term "bullion", a rough Sylvan translation of its words for "refinement" or "melting". This name was given to it by Archipelian settlers, who considered the place a melting pot or pure source of [[elemental energy]].

Its [[flipside]] is known as [[Tarnation]], largely used by the people as a place of exile for irredeemable criminals. Due to a common desire for [[Reclamation (Bullion)|reclamation]], Tarnation is seen as a plane of animosity, and though its cultures are complex and interesting, they are sparse and mired in unknown powers: to most, it is seen as a kind of personalized [[Scarlet Skies|Scarlet Sky]].

# History
## First Era
The first [[Bullion#History|era]] of prehistoric [[Bullion]] took place from the [[Age of the Gods]] to around BPT 300,000. With the close of the [[Old world|last world]], Bullion takes shape as one of many [[Remnant|remnants]]. During this time, it is one of many places where water appears as rain from the sky, and eventually [[aboleth]] may have been placed there as tadpoles.

The rains pool here as [[Divinity|gods]] are born. Eventually, [[Bioh]] is said to take her first steps here, granting the infant remnant with potent seeds of life and bounty. [[Elemental energy]] gathers as [[earth]], [[fire]], [[water]], and [[air]] hold a kind of equilibrium in the place.

There is evidence of [[First Magicians]] reaching Bullion in about 550,000 BPT, though evidently it was to harvest energy collected by the echoes. Shortly thereafter, geological and physical evidence of early [[Elemental creatures|elementals]] manifests, likely as the strongest echoes are changed by their hoarding.

In around 500,000 BPT, [[The Gathering]] took place.
## Second Era 

The second era of Bullion took place from 200,000 - 25,000 BPT.

The chains placed on [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]], and the godless animosity of the [[Whill|whills]], cause the formation of the lawless [[flipside]] of [[Tarnation]]. Meanwhile, the obverse side of Bullion began to run wild with native species, and sentient races begin to take shape. At some point, dwarvish tunnelers from [[Archipel]] cross the land bridge and migrate to Bullion to hunt.

During this era, the [[harengon]] society of [[Deepdell]] in the [[Siella Valley]] and the [[Dwarf|dwarvish]] society in [[Holrfold]] first manifest. 

The partial remains of so-called "true chaos" cause the manifestation of [[Elemental creatures#Elder|elder elementals]], which force most life underground and underwater for a time. Around this epoch, a southwestern land bridge from Bullion to Archipel erodes from the influence of the elementals, and is destroyed.

## Third Era
The third era of ancient Bullion began in about 20,000 BPT. Nomadic groups such as those of the [[Upper Kernwelt]] begin to form societies.

In [[BPT 15786]], the society of [[Ith'Paraan]] is first attested to, ruled by the [[Dragon#Astral|astral dragon]] [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]]. Its ancestral capital is located somewhere near [[Mezcoatl]].

In about [[BPT 13300]], the [[Ith'Alnna]] project begins preliminary setup.

### Miserable Age
In [[BPT 12342]], Amakudari perishes when a [[void breaker]] causes a cataclysmic reaction shortly after lifting off. Shortly after, the outbreak of [[Angel's cough]] is attested, and [[Amakudari's phantom|the Promise]] is fulfilled. 

Colloquially, the two centuries immediately following Amakudari's death is known as the **miserable age**.

In approximately [[BPT 12147]], the [[Os'Grun]] meteor struck the [[Wabi Steppe]], punctuating the events of Ith'Paraan's dominance and bringing a close to the void-faring, as well as many of the formative cultures that existed around that time. Collectively, the events of the miserable age result in almost all of Ith'Paraan's population dying or being rendered lost.

The remnant thus enters a bit of a downturn, as simultaneously, the golden city of early [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qaulhain]] also vanishes.
## Fourth Era
The fourth and most modern era of Bullion began in about BPT 5000.

In [[BPT 4720]], [[Archipel|Archipelian]] [[Elf|elven]] conquistadors led by [[Avra Michimolli]] and aided by [[Ithuriel Rysae]], also attended by sibling wiches [[Aedil Rysae]] and [[Maedil Rysae]], crossed the strait between Archipel and Bullion (later known as the [[Strait of Ithuriel]]). 

These conquistadors lay claim to the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]], forming the [[Throne of Mana]] and the [[Luminaria]] of [[Arnecca]] (later [[Eleyda]]).

# Miracle City
There is a tradition in Bullion of anointing each city where an [[Eidolon|Eidolon]] is born as a **Miracle City**. There are 14 eidolons in modern Bullion, though a dozen other cities have historically once been Miracle Cities.
