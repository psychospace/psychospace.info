An **ambassador star** is a magic item in the form of a badge, originally created to allow the [[Sacred Royal Ultra]] abroad to communicate with others at home, even when far away. It essentially allows the user to project themselves far away, able to vaguely see the surroundings of the image, though with the caveat that they cannot project themselves anywhere they are not allowed.
