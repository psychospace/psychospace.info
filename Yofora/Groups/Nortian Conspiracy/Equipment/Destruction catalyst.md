The **destruction catalyst** is a catalytic [[Mana|Mana]] crystal which can be used as a powerful [[Alchemy|alchemical]] weapon.

This small red translucent gemstone is about the size of a palm and is in the shape of a pentagon, with a yellow symbol etched into it. The symbol is Abyssal and means "Destruction". It is the infamous weapon of [[Blister]].

>>*Wondrous item, very rare*
>>
>>As an action while using the Destruction Catalyst, you can eradicate material and transmute it into arcane force. Within a line 100 feet in length, 10 feet wide and tall, you can instantly destroy all non-living material not being worn or carried. If any magical material, such as any [[Infusion|magic item]], is within the range, your destruction stops at the point at which it tried to destroy that magical material. Based on the physical worth, rarity, and type of material you eradicated, arcane force is extracted and placed into the crystal. This force is cumulative: each time you use this action, the force continues to build within the crystal.
>> 
>> If the crystal tries to destroy material while its stored value in excess of 1,000 [[Gold piece|gp]] in physical worth, the catalyst is at risk of detonating. Roll 1d20. On a 20, you eradicate material and the additional force is placed within the catalyst. On a 19-5, you eradicate space but do not accrue any more force, instead shunting the additional force into psychospace (producing a ghost-like oasis effect). On a 5 or lower, the crystal detonates and you do not eradicate material. When the crystal detonates, everyone within 15 feet must make DC 13 Dexterity saving throws or take 3d10 piercing damage. The creature using the catalyst automatically fails this saving throw. Once the crystal detonates, it becomes nonmagic.
>> 
>> In terms of equivalent exchange, this gemstone is purely "output". Attempting to manually reinsert arcane force into this crystal will result in its detonation.
>> 
>> To detect magic, this gemstone gives off strong *transmutation* magic.
