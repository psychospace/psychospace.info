The **Link of Life** is a span bridging the [[Giant Forest]] of [[Low Sacred]] to the [[Falknjir Mountains]] in [[High Sacred]]. It is one of eight spans between the two [[Remnant|remnants]] of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. It is an ancient dryad creation from dozens and dozens of years prior.

An archdryad was said to craft this vine upon Sacred's [[Breaking of Sacred|initial split]], ensuring that the two fated to drift apart would not. It's not much of a bridge, but it is very strong and cannot be broken so long as the archdryads' corpse, somewhere in the deepest reaches of Low Sacred's soil, remains undisturbed.
