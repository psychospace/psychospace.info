> In the course of nature, all motivated things aspire to create a more pristine, unspoiled environment to live and thrive in. We do it, and indeed "monsters" do it. By my reckoning, the singular difference between us is that a monster's optimum environment is as impossible an assertion as their extinction.

A **monster** or **monstrosity** is a generic term for any [[creature]] widely considered dangerous and unnatural in some regard, be they animal, [[immortal]], or [[figment]]. 

In a more specific definition, monsters are any creatures distorted and malformed by [[magic]], refusing to accept [[Universe|reality]]: attacking others indiscriminately and mercilessly, in order to fulfill this desire or to make a better environment for itself. 

A [[buster]] is a hunter of monsters.

Monsters leave lasting impacts on their environment, both [[Off-wave|psychospacially]] and physically. Though many are as simple-minded as animals, just as many are capable of speech and reason.
