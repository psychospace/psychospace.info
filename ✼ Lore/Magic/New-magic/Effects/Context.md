In [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]] study, a **context** is a [[Logic|logical]] world-state. It can describe a situation, a [[worldline]], a real-base, or anything between, but it primarily describes the effects of [[Reality-Bending|reality-bends]] upon reality itself, as its contexts are modified and might not congeal correctly.

In a pair of contexts, one is determined to be the *low-activity context* (LAC), that which has the fewer changes from the [prior state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) (ex. when things "don't happen"). Alternately, the other state is called the *high-activity context* (HAC, ex. when things "happen"). A **chiral context** can't happen at the same time as its opposite or mirror context: it represents a scenario where something either does or does not happen.

Notably, [[Out There|outer space]] fails to support logic, and thus usually fails to support contexts coherent to dwellers under the [[Welkin]].
