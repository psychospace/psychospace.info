![[⎋ 2FPG]]"**Clover**" is the known alias of the leader of the [[Single-Brain Cell]]. Also known as "Sunny Day" or "Fox", they are a founding member and [[Broadcaster]], apparently the adopted child of [[R. S. Langford]]. Their true identity is unknown to the general public.

According to authorities, Clover is the "director" of the SBC's activities, having orchestrated their plans, guided their members, and escaped or facilitated escape from multiple Shibboleth holding-centers without any trace. Their [[Codec]] is known to grant them or others around them an insane amount of luck, and consequently extreme skill using a [[firearm]].

# Descriptions by authorities
Though psychological profiles are largely incomplete of the enigmatic figure, Clover appears to be meticulous and vicious. 

They have been recorded speaking with an east [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qauli]] dialect of [[Mänyya]], are known to wear bifocals, and are physically disabled, requiring a walking aid. It has also been suggested by some sources that Clover is a dark-furred [[kitsune]] (hence their alias of "Fox") and may be romantically involved with another member of SBC.

# Public sentiment

Sightings matching these criteria are to be reported to [[Blue Cinder Militia]] authorities *immediately*, and suspects should not be approached unless with an [[Ehrgeiz]]. Rewards for information leading to their capture total over 3,000[[Gold piece|gp]].
