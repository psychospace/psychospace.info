An ex-member of [[Heartknock]] who was killed by the guardians of the prince under the [[Tree of Time]]. Mauryus had defected from the Heartknock once before back in [[Yofora]], and was always tinkering with the [[Shiny Mask|mask]] and its properties. With the help of some internal defectors, his replacement mask was also tampered with.
