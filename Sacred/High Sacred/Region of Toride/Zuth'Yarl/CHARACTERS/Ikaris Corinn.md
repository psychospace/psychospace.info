**Ikaris Corinn** is an arcane trickster, a [[Elf#Wood elves|wood elf]], an explorer and cartographer. He used to be a member of [[Critical Hit]], though these days spends his years exploring and researching [[Muttermeadow]].

# Appearance
Ikaris has a flair for the dramatic, and for the amusing aspects of the world. He memorizes his spells, able to use them to maintain his cover. He wields a saber in one hand (mechanically, a rapier), and a shortsword in another. 

He uses House Corinn's unique method of assassination, alternating between using his saber in both standard and reverse grip to open the opponent up to a swift stab. Around his wrist, he wears the arcane focus for his spells, a rose quartz crystal.

# History

One of many children of the elven house of Corinn, like his brothers and sisters, Ikaris set out aboard the airship *Misty Box* from his home in [[Bullion]], to garner his family's trust and renown by exploring the world. In pursuit of this, he joined Critical Hit as a founding member.

## Current Activities
He now acts as the Dino family's official cartographer, operating under the orders of [[House Burgitsk]] to scour and survey the land. He can still be spotted amidst the capitol.

Ikaris is 199, or about 26 in human years.
