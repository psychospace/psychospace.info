**Scarla Nitrum Parasom**^[Скарла Нитрум] was a contessa of [[New Orc City]], the modern persona of the [[Tzitzimitl|tzitzimitl]] named **Nemain**. Incredibly cutthroat, she was behind the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], possessing the body of Empress [[Bianca Nortia]], and by all accounts the true power behind the [[Heartknock|Heartknock]] and the [[Dragonic War]].

She was the wife of [[Illarion Parasom]] (whom she herself apparently widowed), and eclipsed him in anger and power. She was, by extension of the events of [[Zero Day]], an avatar of [[Arizhmiya]].

# History
Nemain originally reached this world during the [[Unknown Era]]. In it, she was responsible for monitoring the use of time.

# Goals
Scarla's goal with the conspiracy was to claim the power of the once-conjoined dragons [[Uforia]] and [[Arahabaki]], using a war and several magical artifacts which could scope out the necessary powers for doing so. After attaining this power, her goal was to use the power of [[occultation]], germinating within Arahabaki, to transcend [[the Planet]] and commune with her [[Outsider]] hosts. These Outsiders would have captured the entire world should her plan have succeeded.

However, this transcendence triggered a reaction by [[Exponen]]. On [[Zero Day]], before she could complete her communion using the [[sky-scrape]], she was defied and slain by the [[S4]].
