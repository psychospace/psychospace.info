The **School of the Heartknock** was a cult apparently seduced by the tenets of [[Arizhmiya]]. Their iconography involved [[Rivenium|riven]] gauntlets, their typical [[Shiny Mask|shiny masks]], and the [[Crest of Conception]]. It formed several months prior to the onset of the [[Dragonic War]], and was instrumental in its beginning. 

# Goals
Apparently dedicated to a plan of awakening the "beating heart" of the planes, as well as unlocking the heart's truest potentials, the Heartknock was founded by [[Amanita Parasom|Kingdle Fire]] and [[Octavia Parasom|Kingdle Coal]] to stoke the fires of rebellion and conduct social and [[Psionics|psychic]] experiments on the masses. They created [[ghost storm|ghost storms]] through manipulating [[Runic engine|runic engines]], causing many to go missing.

In reality, the School was formed to investigate and discover the source of [[occultation]] which [[Arizhmiya]] spoke of, and also to help foster and guide this power into the [[Nortian Conspiracy]]'s control.

# Membership
It was originally based out of the *[[Caged Bird]]*. There were 18 leaders, termed "sutures", each of whom ran a particular experiment ordered by the Kingdles. Among these were:
- [[Mauryus]], who was investigating the [[Tree of Time]]
- [[Phys]], who was investigating [[Otell Sanctum]]
    - and [[Judia Naz]] who replaced them
- [[Magnet (tiefling)|Magnet]], captured nearby [[Gateway]]
- The suture who captured [[Yaarda Fort]]
- The suture who caused [[Paletta]] problems in [[Hope Springs]]
- The suture who summoned the troll into [[Ladybug]]
- The suture creating items in [[Burun]]
