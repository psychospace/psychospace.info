The **Maian Scabbard** is the true scabbard of [[Dinofang]], used in legend, named for the [[Maian Anseri|Queen]] who initially set out to order Dinofang, [[Maian Anseri]], in [[899 PT]]. 

The Maian Scabbard takes the form of a sort of binding chain around Dinofang's hilt, which becomes a bracelet on the attuned creature. Provided the chain is attached to Dinofang, a creature wearing the bracelet can bring the blade to their fingertips in a moment's notice.

It was hunted down and obtained by [[Star of the North]] as part of her training with [[Ridd of Chained-Earth]] in early [[1251 PT]].
