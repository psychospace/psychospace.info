The **Mark of Tears** was a specially-created [[Magic|magical]] mark issued by [[Serena Nortia]] on all willful and knowing [[Nortian Conspiracy|traitors]] to the [[Empress of Nortia]] (at the time [[Bianca Nortia]]). It resembled two blue, jagged lines which encircled the head around each of the eyes, and thus resembled tears, hence its folk name.

It was created as a result of a [[wish]] on [[Uforia]] shortly before [[Zero Day]] in [[1251 PT]]. Using Uforia's umbral [[Ekaitz|power over lightning]], the mark scarred the [[Body|bodies]] of such traitors, so that they could be not hide, and would be brought to justice.

# Known Bearers
Due to the subterfuge with which the [[Nortian Conspiracy]] operated, it was unprecedented how vast an effect it would have on the end of the [[Dragonic War]], enabling the immediate and total reprisal of the subterfuge and related efforts.

- [[Scarla Nitrum]]
- [[Illarion Parasom]]
- [[Ink of Angelblood]]
- [[Wren Doggabone]]
- [[XO]]
- [[Tank Rivelz]]
- Many members throughout the command structure of the [[Navy of Cacophony]] and [[Army of Euphony]]

Intriguingly, [[Amanita Parasom|Amanita]] and [[Octavia Parasom]], nor any [[Heartknock]] members, were never found to bear the mark; Amanita and Octavia truly believed they were helping [[Bianca Nortia]] and Serena with all the horror and terror they wrought.
