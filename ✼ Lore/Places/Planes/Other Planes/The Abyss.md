The **Abyss**, or **Enitor**, is the name for the various [[Flipside|flipsides]] of the [[Remnant|Hells]] of the [[Scarlet Skies]].

From the excess and overflow of gathered ichor, that which found its way through [[Phantasm|phantasms]] cooled and chilled from its molten state into slag and rocky bloodstone, new beings are born, the polar opposite of [[Devil|devilkin]]. These beings, [[Demon|demons]], once waged a horrid [[Blood War]] over the true nature of [[Soul|souls]] with their opposing force, with no victor ever decided. 

It is a natural property of [[The Planet]] that each Hell must have an Abyssal layer. Every layer's core leads to the same fully-alternate plane known as **Enitor** (sometimes also called incepted space, or Erebus). This is what makes them “layers” of the same location, as Enitor can take a creature from one layer to another or into its own infinite depths.

In reality, the assumption that there are as many Hells as Abyssal layers in the Heavens is misguided and misinformed, as is proven by [[Yofora]]. Of the many alternate planes of existence that take shape as flipsides, Abyssal layers tend away from the mortal plane, but are as varied as any other.
