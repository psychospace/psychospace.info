The **old world** refers to a prehistoric world which existed prior to the pervasiveness of [[Psychospace]], before the existence of [[Remnant|remnants]], and before the rise of the [[Divinity|gods]]. The **new world** is the epoch which followed, beginning sometime around the year BPT 1,000,000.

Due to the betrayal of [[Arizhmiya|Lagacia]], the old world's true nature has fallen into unreachable obscurity.

# Mythos
Long ago, before all recorded history that remains in the Heavens, the society which dwelled on [[The Planet]] achieved a singular “will”.

How remains puzzling. Civilization's very nature should beget combat, competition, and conquest. However, if peace were reached, such a state could have also been found, but it would require nobody to be outside the realm of contact. Many theologians of the Heavens puzzle on why this was: perhaps, the enemies of the main nations were reduced to nothing, or perhaps they had just been so soundly crushed that they had no choice but to unite the world under one flag.

What is important is that society did reach this point. An “event horizon” of information had been reached where nobody possessed any information they did not also share. This was the united will of nations: the unity of information begets a unity of purpose.

The world was brought to an end by the [[War of Chaos]].
