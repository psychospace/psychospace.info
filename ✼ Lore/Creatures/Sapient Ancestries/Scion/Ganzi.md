A **ganzi** is a broad designation for a [[creature]] with [[scion|scion]] heritage sourced from the [[Chartless Sea]]. Defined by individuality and independence, like [[Genasi|genasi]] they are born enriched by primordial [[chaos]] in its rawest form.

No two ganzis share the exact same physical traits, even ganzis of the exact same species or ancestry; the "pure" chaos in this state refuses to be individuated even as it struggles to conform to [[logic]].

Though ganzis have been well-documented throughout history, it wasn't until the surprising appearance of [[Tailed Stranger|a strange teenaged ganzi]] and the advent of [[new magic]] drove their propensity for chaotic magic into the limelight.

# Appearance
Ganzis are impressively varied in shape and size, and they differ from their home ancestry in impressively unsubtle ways that struggle to be categorized: no universal traits between all ganzis can be identified. Alterations in skin, eye, and hair color, scales replacing skin, flowing aspects of the body, and feathers growing along hair are just some of the many traits expressed by ganzi. 

Many ganzis (around 30%, what is considered a "slight majority") possess what are called "proteankin" features, which, regardless of their actual chaotic heritage, grant them lengthy serpent tails which merge ungracefully and uncaringly between scale, fur, and feather, similar to the biotic patterning of [[protean|proteans]]. These tails are somewhat independent of the ganzi they are attached to, known for being mischievous and assistive in mysterious ways. Proteankin ganzis are what most consider archetypical of ganzis, but that is a narrow definition.

Regardless of how the ancestry develops, its features are seemingly always bilaterally symmetrical, its features patterned along two axes.

# Culture
Ganzis have no singular homeland in the Heavens, and thus lack well-established or widespread traditions. Culturally, they are known for and draw towards wandering, learning magic at an accelerated rate, creating art in many forms, and typically being flamboyant or expressive. 

Ganzis, similar to [[tiefling|tiefs]] and [[aasimar|aasimars]], are often raised with certain special expectations from their homes or communities. However, these children of chaos have an in-built anarchy and zest that has largely led to them being considered irrepressible. If a ganzi was born into a family line, they would typically be raised same as any other child, although they might be more of a troublemaker than others.

Many ganzi-centric communities have emerged in [[Bullion]], due to its storied history with primal chaos, particularly in [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qaulhain]] and the [[Siella Valley]]. Although ganzis themselves are mildly uncommon, it is not a particularly rare sight to see ganzis among the ranks of the [[Kuroki Keiichi]] or other nomadic groups.

## Origins

Due to the relatively uncontrolled nature of the Chartless Sea, it is believed most often that a ganzi is born in times and places where chaos has taken particular root, rather than blood, as with other scions. It is believed uncommon for the inchoate entities of the Chartless Sea themselves to sire young with mortals, much like other [[Monitor|monitors]] and much unlike [[celestial|celestials]] and [[fiend|fiends]]. 

Some also believe to have been born a ganzi as a direct result of heritage attributed to [[Void breaker|void farers]] or bearers of the [[Gift of Stars]].


# Etymology
The term "ganzi" is from [[Oa'Rovi]].
