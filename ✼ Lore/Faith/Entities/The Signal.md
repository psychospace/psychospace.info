The **unwelcome presence** (colloquially “**the Signal**” or “*the stranger tide*”) is the term given by researchers to an esoteric hypnotic pattern or entity which occasionally leaks through [[psychospace]] and can be picked up by and influence _[[Verlan|verlan]]_ instruments. 

It appears to have a mind of its own, and its origin is unknown. It is theorized to be either the creation of an [[Outsider|Outsider]], or an Old One itself, connected with [[the Fortress]].

# Manifestations
>[!quote | author subtitle] Linguistic patterning *example of a secondary manifestation of [[The Signal|the signal]]*
><small>"The judicator. The storm brewing in your cup. The one without the two. They kept telling the client that I'd keep my client. Brother to sister, man to man. Dead and not alive. The client continued to wake. Material, shape, a canal without lightning. You've always been the way you've never been. Collaboration is the death of collaboration. Fear her. Two days later I went to bed in his tower, and he was never heard from again. Two days later there was a new body."</small>


It is said to manifest most commonly in "primary" manifestations, as an unending flow of numeric information that fills the mind or invades signal carriage networks. 

In what are called "secondary" manifestations, it forms itself as a type of nonsense poetry. 

A certain number of individuals are preternaturally aware of the presence, gaining [[Codec|powers]] beyond imagination by transcoding it, and the term “[[Broadcaster]]” was invented to classify them.
# Effects

While living creatures process this information in terms they can understand, inanimate objects, including corpses, are altered and often awakened by its existence. This process is called **Signalization**. ^d5cf12

When a leak of the Signal (a “*shimmer*”) is found, its formation possesses such things, turning them mobile and often hostile to life, attacking and coordinating with other Signalized objects. This can reanimate corpses, bring buildings to life, make whole towns uproot, or even mold a body from the earth itself in rare cases.

In controlled environments, study of the presence has also given rise to [[Thaumaturgy]], a study of magic akin to [[Witchcraft]], and one of several so-called “[[New Magic|new magics]]”. 

# History
Detailed by [[Viers Callinan]], in [[616 PT]], when the [[elseworld]] [[616 E-PT|suffered]] a [[Collapse state|collapse state]] and became darkened, there emerged a powerful "[antinoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference)" which manifested then, deafening [[the Planet]] to any cries for help from its opposite, in doing so further locking away the doomed reality. [[Syncretism|Syncretists]] now believe that this was the earliest manifestation of the Signal.

The first modern discovery of the Signal occurred in [[1245 PT]] when [[Amanita Parasom|Amanita]] and [[Octavia Parasom]] completed the *[[Visage of the Fortress]]* ritual, hearing a strange whispering noise emerging on the final layer (which mimicked [[Väräh]]). Though they were able to evade it through using their [[Soul bond|soul bond]], it produced a globule of energy they called a "bubble", which refused to be dispelled and which turned any physical attacks on it back on them.

%%Later, remnants of the signal were again detected%%
