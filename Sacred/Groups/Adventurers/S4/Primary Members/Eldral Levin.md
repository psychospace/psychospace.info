**Eldral "El" Levin** is a 25-year-old (as of [[1251 PT]]) [[Human]] cleric of [[Cientia]]. He was an original member of the [[S4]].

He was born to [[Godwin Levin]] and [[Annette Levin]] in [[Osprey Bay]] and has 3 older siblings. 

Eldral was named after the mighty warrior [[Eldral Strongbow]] because his parents wished him to be a great fighter. However, after failing out of the local swordfighting academy due to lack of interest, El found his calling in the priesthood of the goddess of the Sun as a healer. Despite starting late, he quickly advanced and became a proficient healer. 

El, while not opposed to fighting, tried to find diplomatic solutions to problems. He is objectively terrible at this but he tries anyway. He is also a recovering alcoholic.

He dreams of starting a remnant-wide network of hospitals where all are treated without concern for ability to pay. He also wishes to find the mythical Aurelia tree, whose fruit is said can cure any disease. 

He answers the call to adventure to begin working as a traveling healer while also gathering funds for his first clinic. While some part of him wants the fame and fortune associated with adventuring, he is mostly content to help people as best he can.
