Dr. **Enoch  Triverus Starfell** was an accomplished cleric from a foreign land, now corrupted into a [[Slime|slimy]] form.

They act in service to a kind [[Avatar of Death]], named [[Sinister]]. Practically inhuman in their pursuits of healing and restoration, no longer distinguishable in gender. Their body and true name is lost to them, but not their spirit, morals, or power. Surely partially immortal.

Their body has become a void of inky black darkness, "healed beyond all possible injury". Their cloak, wings, and caduceus stave are separate from them.

As their title of "Doctor" suggests, they are a healer of great renown.

Starfell's surname is oft mentioned in more modern scriptures, often alongside the epithet "Dread Angel". It is unknown whether or not this refers to E.T. or another of their line, which they say has studied and worshipped Sinister for many generations.

# History

Starfell was once a traveller, researching the vanishing of master magician [[Viers Callinan]] and his many inventions and abandoned threads of research across his bases all around the world. This search led them to the storm-encroached remnant of [[Yofora]], and during this time some 22 years ago, they encountered many curious things, including [[XO]] and [[Hazel Sobol]]. Eventually, through coercion and secrecy, learning the art of hiding in a shadow, Starfell found their way into the *Nosebleed*, Viers' portable base held within "the Wizscraper", and were assaulted by powerful visions of [[Ink of Angelblood|darkness surrounded by light]].

E.T. decided that this line of inquiry was dangerous enough and fled the land as a stowaway, although this time spent without "being" led to them losing memory of the research venture, leaving the only records of the events within its pages, determining, if anything, that the *Nosebleed* is a lost cause. They've been through many vessels and places since, until eventually reaching Sacred by chance, although as the journal describes, each time they "are not", they lose their recent memory upon reawaking.

Starfell knew not why they were here in [[Low Sacred]] but felt an approaching noise of dark energies which they've "heard before". In a way, Starfell was drawn back to Sacred in a calling to eliminate [[Ink of Angelblood]].

They encountered the [[S4]] near [[Beastmaw Canyon]] and offer a peculiar form of aid to the nearest town, [[Midzone]], stamping out monsters that threaten the pacifists there. They have earned the nickname "Rook".
