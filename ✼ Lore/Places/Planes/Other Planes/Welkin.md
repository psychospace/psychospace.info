**Welkin** is the [[Shindani]] term for the dwelling-place of the divine pantheon of [[Divinity|gods]]. It has been witnessed by several entities. From here, the gods send projections of themselves which act on the mortal plane. It is widely believed to exist somewhere within the highest derivations of [[Kibangan]].

Welkin is bridged to [[The Heavens|the Heavens]] by way of [[Unwri]]. Souls that are reborn do so through [[Mana (plane)|Mana]], Welkin's realm of boundless energy.

In [[Bullion]] specifically, it is sometimes called "*The Great Nowhere*".
