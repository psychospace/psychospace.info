**Divination** is the [[Magic]] study of **diviners** or **prophets**, and is one of the eight [[Classical Schools]] of magic, interlinked with [[illusion|illusion]]. Divination is the study of unraveling hidden truths, discerning intent, fate, or the future through minor aberrations in [[Logic|Logic]]. 

This is accomplished through the observation and vulnerabilities of [[psychospace|psychospace]], and especially [[Psinomenon|psinomena]], some of which can be interpreted into words through *loci*, tiny pockets into the [[Welkin]] perceptible with [[Senzai]] alone: the discovery of these are known to the study as gazing through their "third eye". Diviners can also view, hear, and speak across vast distances through redefining these loci.

Diviners are sometimes also called the direct speakers of the [[divinity|divines]], as these loci into the Welkin reveal many things to them about the nature of the future, and provide occasional, non-corporeal access to other powerful entities across [[The Heavens]].
