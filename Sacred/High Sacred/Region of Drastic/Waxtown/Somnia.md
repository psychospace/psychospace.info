In preservation of the Worldream, the native groups who believed in the [[Sleepy Yore]] often formed villages and pacts with their surroundings and resources, seeking the divine attribution in everything. One such village came to be known as the people of **Somnia**, somewhere north of where [[Waxtown]] stands today.

# History

One day, long ago, a terrifying dragon threatened the remnant. To avoid its wrath, Somnia formed a pact with an ancient angel, granting it a form of divine protection. Even to this day, this angelic barrier lives on in each person of Somnia, leading to them being beacons of personality and protection should they ever find themselves in the outside world. The druids of Somnia take on names in [[Celestial language|Celestial languages]] in honor of this accord, training day and night to see the Skies Beyond where their ally flew to their aid that fateful day.

Naturally, the people of Somnia have something of an affinity for [[Aasimar]], believing them to be wholesome influences, even somewhat still when they have fallen from grace. This has led to the newest generation of Somniites becoming fans of the [[Velocis Dino|current queen]] of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], a mighty aasimar knightess, much to the dismay of their traditionalist foremothers and forefathers.
