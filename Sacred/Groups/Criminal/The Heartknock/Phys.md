**Phys** was a liberated [[changeling]] who prided himself on having seized control of the dwarves and various other Underdarkites at [[Otell Sanctum]], but in the end, he was tricked by [[Ikabod Caruso]]. He cursed himself for the deception, but in fact his inquiries inadvertently led to the uncovering of the Prince's [[Dragonic Curse]].

Like many of the earlier inductees of [[Heartknock]], he answered directly to [[Octavia Parasom|Kingdle Coal]] and [[Amanita Parasom|Kingdle Fire]].

He was user of the **[[Shiny Mask]]** until his death. He took his own life using the **duergar crasher**.
