![[⎋ 2FPG]]

>One undeniable fact is known. [[The Planet]] has changed. 
>
>To those of you who were alive for it, you|'d never forget wherever you were when [[Sky-scrape|the world was scarred]], burning with a force that nearly ate the sky.  To those of you who weren't, you were told time and again growing up that reality was different, ever since that day.
>
>The day that a simple [[S4|band of adventurers]], heroes of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]] and [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]], saved the prince, the empire, and the planet, whether they knew that or not. The day when the earth beneath your feet almost slipped into freefall. The day that defined today.
>
>The day when magic began to mutate. The day [[Elseworld|the reflected sky]] manifested. 
>
>It was the day everyone, no matter their creed or caste, had their lives flashed before them, as the [[Dark Sea]] was torn open. The day when the layers of [[Väräh]] and [[Umbraid]], the planes of metal and wood, reemerged from their unknown hiding places, these mysterious elemental bulwarks against… you don't know what. You wish you didn't have to wonder what. 
>
>It was the day the [[End Times]] began, if you believe some people. Some call it the Incursion of the Empire, the Unraveling, the Undawn, or the Second [[The Gathering|Gathering]]. 
>
>But for simplicity's sake, most just call it… [[Zero Day]]. 
>
>The last day everything seemed normal. Or, to put it another day: the first day of the **new** normal.
>
>---
>In the decades since Zero Day, there's been no shortage of strange daily occurrences. 
>
>The first changes were quickly obvious. With the mutation of magic, what was once simple miracles became laborious work. The tumbling of certain islands into the [[Scarlet Skies]], the scattering of the delicate balance of fiendish power, caused untold damage to the flow of souls.
>
>Now, even for the most decadent of nobility, [[resurrection]] is difficult and tedious, making mercenary assassinations all the more lucrative. Random spells seemed stronger, while other spells became impossible, sometimes fluctuating on a day to day basis. 
>
>Some creatures lost or gained powerful magic, forced into hiding or migration, while new deviants invaded and occupied their home. Shadows leapt to life, and others were eaten by them. The [[aphorite|aphorites]] and shadowkin began to emerge from abandoned buildings, half-burnt forests, or cracked mirrors: denizens of [[The Fortress|planes]] adjacent to our own which few understand, and scion influences over mortalkind.
>
>Yet the most insidious changes began to manifest in the years that followed. Dangerous weather systems became a norm. The temperature began to rise as solar magic improved. The fear that the apocalypse was soon to come led to a rise in both hyper-religious and atheistic beliefs, stirring panicked conflicts in regions like [[Archipel]]. 
>
>The rise in town or city-wide “coincidents” of historical plagues, births of ‘[[Omen|omen beings]]' with bright eyes and mystical prowess, and greater reports of unknown and untold entities and events are but some of the common new weirds found across the Planet. 
>
>But we have not yet mentioned the most potent change.
>
>---
>
>When Zero Day happened, something… fundamental was altered, something which whispered forth from the skies itself. Nobody knows what that *something* really was. Yet, it caused a most obvious and frightening changes of all — a *deviation*. A branching reality, and with it: a branch in magic.
>
>The term which congealed to describe this revolution in magical affairs is, simply, [[new magic]].
>
>The everyman would not know the intricacies of new magic, only the warnings: most potently, if you see the stars bleed, if you see the [[Cien|sun]] start to run like an egg yolk, don't think twice: you just get the *fuck* out of there. 
>
>What most understand about new magic is that it consists of direct, descriptive, and powerful meddling with the state of the world. If magic, bound by that [[Divine Equation]], existed in a harmony with the contours of reality, these people [[reality-bending|kick reality]] into the shape of their choosing, making the impossible possible.
>
>Many “[[magic#clade|clades]]” of new magic are apparently easy to learn, and far more unpredictable than anything which came before it. The users of new-magic, [[Psion|psions]], upset the balance and common understanding that magicians before had to study for their entire lives.
>
>Resisting or abusing the call of this force is liable to cause all manner of ill-conceived consequences on the caster and the world around them. Novel monsters erupting from the body. Strange sicknesses, disorders both physical and psychological. Immature criminals now with more power than they know what to do with. And now, the real threat of an [[Collapse state|end to all life]].
>
>Despite its name, there are whispers that what is today called ‘new magic' is old and wildly potent — rooted in the mysterious “[[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]]” that many have been so infatuated with since Zero Day, chasing after rumors and ruins wherever they crop up, before vanishing with whatever they find. One might say it's a new gold rush to track down each and every 'lynchpin-tier' anomaly that crops up.
>
>The most powerful psions are truly noteworthy. Known as [[Broadcaster|Broadcasters]] or exemplars, they are famous and infamous alike for their mythic, superpowered potential to bend reality without effort, and often without detection or recourse. Some romanticize Broadcasters as “new gods”… but that's totally ridiculous, right? There's no way that ecoterrorist assholes like the [[Single-Brain Cell]] or child-murdering psychopaths like the [[Geladoe cartel]] are really fit to be called “gods”… *right?!*
>
>Those calling for blood have good reason to doubt the premise that new magic is natural, to doubt that liberation and decriminalization of these monstrous powers is the right call… given the number of victims left behind (or worse, not left at all) when new magic is used for good or ill. 
>
>But, their existence, their defenders, and, occasionally, their peaceful cohabitation, proves difficult to reconcile all the same. 
>
>Psions are still people, deep down, and have little choice in being immaculately gifted, nor choice in the threat they pose. It's an open question if psions are worthy of respect, equality, suppression, therapy, or destruction: and most try not to think about it, something becoming increasingly hard to blame them for.
>

>Scholars are still unsure what exactly makes new magic tick, as well as why the Väräh and Umbraid returned. But the race to understand, control, and counteract the immense threats to the world occupies the existential zeitgeist of this new era, and especially the hearts of the people living within it. 
>
>Governments the world over have treated the outbreak of anomalies following Zero Day with a wide gamut of solutions and care. In [[Bullion]] specifically, it was the [[Fifth Institute]] that first took action; this was their bread and butter. The forces of their [[Chirologist|chirologists]] rushed to discover and control whatever causes or creates new magic. Ironic, considering the land was also the source of the first voices to speak up in favor of rhetoric of understanding and care, given its ancient accord with the forces of [[Witchcraft|witchcraft]]. 
>
>With the sentiment so split between support and outcry, for so many years, things seem to be at a standstill for now...
>
>The danger is emblematic of a persistent struggle which has grown over the intervening decades since Zero Day — between order and chaos, friction and freedom, the normal and abnormal, love and logic, control and revolution, the saints and the saintless. 
>
>These conflicts are the spinal column of the new world order, challenged to adapt to the times… and to protect themselves from the unknown.
>
>And this brings us here. To this moment. 
>
>To 1285 PT, thirty four years since the world almost ended.
