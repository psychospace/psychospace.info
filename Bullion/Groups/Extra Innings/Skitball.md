**Skitball** was^[According to [[Numberless Children|Nulk]] collective research efforts.] a team-based ball game played on a field, involving bases, various pieces of equipment, and excellent teamwork. Apparently, it was played for some time prior to [[1243 PT]], a favorite of the kids at the [[Lavas Hideaway]] particularly, and was a cultural export of the [[Emirate of Qaulhain]].

However, as a result of a new god known as [[The Pitcher|the Pitcher]] and the circumstances of [[Mass-Resurrection Incident|its ascension]], the rules of skitball were [[altercation|apparently torn whole-cloth]] from the [[psychospace|collective memory]] of the [[The Planet|entire planet]], appropriated for the Pitcher's "[[Base (XI)|game]]" to recover its memories. Since then, its vanishing from the world has been a subject of both [[new magic|neophobic and neophiliac]] interest, although the ruleset remains difficult to recreate exactly.

As with most games, it was known that each match of skitball had a concrete end after a certain period of time. When both teams had scored the same amount of points, "[[‚çü Extra Innings|extra innings]]" were played as a tiebreaker, instead. When a winner had been decided, the equipment and players would "lose their collective use". 

Given the nature of the divine game the Pitcher was playing, effectively extra innings for their game with [[Ciro Enfys]], the notion of being bereft of use haunted the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident|Mass-Resurrection]] victims for the rest of their lives.
