A **perícopa**^[(from [[Mänyya]] meaning "a cutting-out" or "tract")] is a term used by the [[Institutes of Bullion]] as an umbrella term for discussion on a particular intrigue or inquiry, consolidating it under a basic "question" about "what we know".

Perícopas are usually numbered, and individualized to the Institutes they originated from. For example, Fifth Institute [[Perícopa Doce]] (12) is their long-standing inquiry into [[Lynchpin device|lynchpin devices]].
