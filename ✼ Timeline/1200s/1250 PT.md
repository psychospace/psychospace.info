###  4-30-1250

In the midst of this attempt to use her ability, she is cut off and possessed by [[Scarla Nitrum]].

### 6-16-1250
Bianca's soul is apparently unreachable: her [[body]] is used to coerce [[Amanita Parasom|Amanita]] and [[Octavia Parasom]] to work for her by claiming that their stepmother was taken captive. In the panic, [[Illarion Parasom]] assumes emergency powers using [[Project KC]] as a pretense, and uses the [[Prime Doppelguard]] to act in her place. [[Serena Nortia|Serena]], Bianca's daughter, is unaware of this. The Doppelguard control Bianca's image by the afternoon, and she assures everyone that nothing is the matter.

## Sabela (7)
### 7-10-1250
[[Junah Rollingstone]] is at last freed from the machinations of [[Dawndust]]'s [[Flipside]], [[Pandemonium]]. This was a great triumph of the Sacred Military and the [[Dawndust]] Listener Corps working in tandem, and the year was annointed this title by the King Tyranno upon return of the troops. Junah aged seven years in the only two year interim and has remained on the nearby remnant of [[Bullion]] since the mission, still in recovery from the events.

### 7-29-1250
Ikabod re-creates the [[Evangel]] "[[Certain (evangel)|Certain]]" from notes taken from an [[Archipel|Archipelian]] warship, binding her to his soul with the power of the [[Lifeblinding|Mark of Lifeblind]]. He records this success in his journal.

## Neun (9)
### 9-21-1250
[[Serena Nortia]] attempts again to use [[monism]] to communicate with her mother [[Bianca Nortia]], but finds her soul is unreachable.

## Zanneter (10)
### 10-5-1250
[[Arthur Graywell]] celebrates his 55th birthday.

### 10-21-1250 
While conducting a domestic investigation south of [[Burun]], [[Serena Nortia]] discovers a facility constructing strange magical items, and a message meant for her tucked in a book from the [[Sovereign's Tower]]. After using [[monism]] on her mother, this realization allows her to find that her mother is apparently unresponsive and locked away: something is very wrong.

## Annaher (11)
### 11-1-1250 
Serena departs for Sacred to investigate the project, believing her life is in danger.

### 11-9-1250
Diviners learn of an oncoming [[ghost storm|strange storm]] about to hit the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. The same day, six monks go missing in mid-teleport. King [[Tyranno Re Ursus]] is alerted.

### 11-10-1250 
In [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]], three other monks, who had yet to get the message about the [[Ghost storm|purple storm]], vanish mid-teleport. A message is passed around that travel via magic is dangerous without a physical medium.

### 11-12-1250 
[[Summer Sundress]] instructs [[Shohei Integra]], who is feeling anxious having stayed for so long within the city of [[Drastic]], to test the mettle of a new recruit, [[Theresa Leighton]], for the membership of [[The Fold]].

### 11-13-1250
[[Tyranno Re Ursus]] announces to the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] that there is to be a temporary ban and strong warning against using teleportation, due to a [[ghost storm|mysterious weather phenomenon]] passing near to the remnant that has seemingly resulted in the sudden loss of a few monks who use teleportation circles to make their way around. 

[[Shohei Integra|Sho]] says farewell to his family and proceeds to take [[Theresa Leighton]] to the test location.

### 11-14-1250
Prince [[Lazuli Dino]], attended by [[Ildy]], [[Lylian Burgitsk]], and 16 [[Burgitsk Houseguard]], begins a trek to [[Rainbow Ridge]].

### 11-18-1250
Prince [[Lazuli Dino|Linnie]]'s convoy is caught in a mysterious [[Ghost storm|purple storm]]. At the end of the night, only 4 of the 16 guards are left accounted for. The Prince was protected by the Shield of Purity cast by [[Ildy]], whilst [[Lylian Burgitsk|Lylian]] was protected by her [[Celestial]] nature and oath. Afterwards, the storm lingers in the Graveland, and many people evacuate. 

On the same night, nearby, [[Shohei Integra]] and [[Theresa Leighton|Tessa]] are also caught in the storm and witness a [[Phantasma Goria|mysterious figure]]. Sho isn't seen again for a while.

### 11-19-1250
Tessa emerges from the [[Ghost storm]] and is displaced to [[Drastic]], atop the [[Saurus Castle|Kingtower]]. She is detained by the [[Dino Airstyle]] and interrogated. After they realize she was subject to a consequence of the purple storm, she is set to return to [[Lond Point]].

### 11-25-1250
Prince [[Lazuli Dino|Linnie]]'s convoy finally arrives in [[Rainbow Ridge]]. [[Lylian Burgitsk]], within Rainbow Ridge, sends word back to her mother that she is safe, and elects to head north to [[Puzzledam]] on her own, hoping that Balthazar will have some means of protecting her until the storm passes. 

On the first day, Prince Linnie meets with [[Ikabod Caruso]] and continues to meet him daily for the remainder of his trip. Ikabod instructs him his plan for curing the prince's curse, but ensures that the process is secret.

### 11-26-1250 
Prince [[Lazuli Dino|Linnie]] consents to have his soul [[clone|cloned]], and Ikabod does so, creating "[[SUEANNIL]]". Ikabod then uses [[Ikabod's surrogate soul]] to retrieve Sue's soul and place it within a [[heart container]] in the middle of his lab. With their heart wrested from them, Sue returns to water.

### 11-27-1250 
The prince's soul, wholly cloned as a heart container, is initially fragmented. Using [[Vibe]] as a filler and bodies of ice and slush to give them a place to inhabit, as a test, Ikabod creates [[Lyrica|No.1]], comprised of the prince's sense of authority. He also attempts to restore Sue to life, but fails.

### 11-28-1250
Using similar methods, Ikabod creates [[Lithop|No.2]] and [[Lacuna|No.3]], both comprised of the prince's caring aspects. These souls seem to be far too happy to withhold the dangerous curse.

### 11-29-1250
Using similar methods, Ikabod creates [[Lethal|No.4]] and [[Lucent|No.5]], both comprised of the prince's tricky aspects. These souls seem closer to what he is aiming for, but do not have any rage within them, only conniving tactics.

### 11-30-1250 
Using similar methods, Ikabod successfully creates No.6, christened [[Locket]], comprised of the prince's creative aspects. Unexpectedly, this is at last successful in withholding a piece of the dark illusionary magic that have the curse within them. 

As a failsafe, and to keep bits and pieces of the heart container so they can restore to full later (without needing the Prince's presence), [[Pendant]] is created as a clone of Locket. Knowing these are likely his most successful creations thus far, he [[Lifeblinding|binds his soul]] to each of them, granting them a will instantaneously while the others slumber and slowly "gather their thoughts" in his lab.

## Gewalt  (12)
### 12-1-1250 
A [[rainbow of transport]] containing a missive from the king reaches Prince Linnie, instructing him to recruit adventurers and go the long way around back to the capitol due to the oddities of the purple storm, as well as investigate and calm some people of [[Low Sacred]], who reportedly were hit hard by the storm's effects. 

On the same day, [[Ikabod Caruso]] offers [[Pendant]] to the [[Dwarf#Duergar|duergar]] of the [[Otell Sanctum]] so that Pendant can be experimented on by them, hopefully uncovering some secret that yet eludes him.

### 12-2-1250
In a break in the storm, [[Arthur Graywell]] departs [[Drastic]] for [[Rainbow Ridge]], curious as to the prince's intentions with the quest as well as seeking an excuse to have a bit of a vacation. 

Having been snared by the storm, [[Shohei Integra]] suddenly pops back into existence near Rainbow Ridge, his [[soul]] damaged. [[Serena Nortia|Serena]], following a passage in the Aeolian [[Apocrypha of Winds]], discovers and repairs him as a guardian angel using [[Monism]].

The tabaxi [[Open-Skies Free Bird|Bird]], feeling happy after finishing his trip to Rainbow Ridge, gathers his things, and just so happens to take a poster for the Prince's quest before proceeding back to [[the Whiskerwood]] by caravan.

### 12-5-1250 
[[Open-Skies Free Bird|Bird]] returns to [[the Whiskerwood]]. In the meanwhile, [[Serratura Neeman|Serratura]] and [[Chiave Neeman|Chiave]] have already decided to adventure out to investigate why nearby [[Phantasm|phantasms]] are failing. Bird gives the two a poster telling them to head north to Rainbow Ridge to join the prince's entourage, and they prepare and move out that evening.

### 12-9-1250
[[Serratura Neeman|Serratura]] and [[Chiave Neeman|Chiave]] arrive in [[Rainbow Ridge]], and witness the prince returning from a tower up north: Ikabod's [[Maline Tower|tower]]. 

Ikabod's ruse, tricking them into experimenting for him, is caught onto by the [[Dwarf#Duergar|duergar]] scout Dilan. A small band of two duergar siege his tower in the night to rob him of more slaves, but [[Trobairitz|Santo]] eliminates them with the [[Broom of stars]].

### 12-11-1250
[[MMT - Arc 1, Nova]] begins. *For more details, see that article.*
