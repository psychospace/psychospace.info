**Mana**, also known as **Arcadia**, is a [[Plane#Sphere|sphere]] of endless [[Vitality energy|positive energy]], and is the origin point where [[Echo|echoes]] are [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] into new [[Soul|souls]] to be born in [[the Heavens]]. It is said to be the [[flipside]] of [[Welkin]], and so likely exists within [[Kibangan]].

[[Melotte]]'s Zodiac aspects oversee this place, as well as the [[jyoti]]. It is said that every [[Star|star]] in the sky, including [[Cien]] and [[Stronn]], contain a [[portal]] to Mana, or to some Mana-like plane.

The material of [[mana]] is named for it.

# Properties

Mythology holds that Arcadia appears as a beautiful garden, court, or small promenade at the foot of a massive metallic-looking branching structure, in a seemingly endless white void, surrounded by an ocean which reflects these elements. 

The very sky gives off light to a ludicrous degree, blinding any mortal [[creature]] who stares into it for too long. The light, while beautiful, heavenly, and peaceful, is said to be an apparatus to cleanse the soul of memories, engendering the process of reincarnation as a past life is wiped from recollection. 

Only a few mortal souls ever recall Mana following the reincarnation process, except for recalling heading into the mythological bright light. Some creatures who [[Succession (ability)|succeed their souls]] or harbor natural resurrective processes, such as [[Dragon|dragons]], describe Mana as a "last stop" before their mortal experience continues.
