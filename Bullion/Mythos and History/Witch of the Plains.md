A legacy of [[Witchcraft|witches]] oversee the outlying [[Aed & Maed]], each of whom bear the title of "**Witch of the Plains**". It is rumored to span over a hundred generations.

In general, the shared knowledge of the hundred-life-long legacy is always inherited, both through the sentience of [[Sōzu|Sōzu]] and the ever-drafted books within [[Arcsend Ranch]].
