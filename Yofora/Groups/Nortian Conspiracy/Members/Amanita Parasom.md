**Amanita Nabokov Parasom**^[Аманита Парасом], sometimes going by "Amy", is a genderfluid [[kalashtar]] researcher and [[magus]]. They were raised the child of [[Illarion Parasom]] and [[Lyudmila Nabakov]].

She acted as a leader of the [[Heartknock]] along with their sibling, [[Octavia Parasom]]. 

# History
Amanita was born in [[1206 PT]]. When she was very young, she recalls Octavia "[[Octavia Parasom#^ef2572|emerged]]" from her shadow.

Amanita was extremely interested in the unseen world from an early age, possibly to uncover more about her sister. The sisters were childhood friends with [[Serena Nortia]], a fellow noble born around the same time: this friendship continued into adulthood. ^850ecb

Their mother, [[Lyudmila Nabakov]], was killed when they were very young.

As Amanita and Octavia reached adolescence, they began to grow more independent and their fervor against the [[Dark Sea]] persisted. They adopted a knack for disguise and theatrics, as well as their interest in becoming a [[Conductors of Court|Conductor]]. 

## Discovery

In [[1245 PT]], Amanita discovered a [[The Signal|"shimmer"]] while experimenting at [[Farborough Manor]].  Personally fascinated with the book *[[Visage of the Fortress]]*, they completed the steps to create an [[Visage of the Fortress#Anomaly|anomaly]] which quickly spiraled out of control, forcing many of their belongings outside of reality. At some point, there persisted a slight space in which light and space would distort without any magic maintaining it, a space Amanita called "the bubble".

Amanita did much research on the bubble, attempting to find out more about how it affected [[Psychospace]], eventually finding out that she had created a stable anomaly-hole to [[The Fortress]] which was slowly growing in size. Farborough Manor had to be continuously reinforced to protect their findings from this.

## Conspiracy
### Beginnings
In [[1250 PT]], Illarion and his wife [[Scarla Nitrum]], through possessing [[Bianca Nortia]], seized control of the [[Great Nortian Empire]]. 

The Parasom children, some of the only people who knew the true [[Arizhmiya|power]] behind the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], founded the Heartknock, and began to recruit many artificers to produce much of their equipment as a rogue research faction and cult, akin to something which existed at the Fifth Institute. They had no idea that they were working to usurp the Nortian line in the process, because Bianca had assured them and coerced otherwise.

Under their respective personas as Kingdle Fire and Coal, they sought to complete their own experiments with magic and identity using the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] as a nationwide test bed.

### Final Encounters
In [[1251 PT]], near to the end of the [[Dragonic War]], the Parasom twins traveled home, leaving behind remaining experiments in [[Triptych]]. The reveal of [[Serena Nortia]] to the Kingdom shortly thereafter had been widely censored to prevent their rebellion specifically, as, although Serena [[Tribute|no longer remembered]], that news would have caused a massive break in the psyche of Amanita and Octavia: that what they were doing was not for Nortia's benefit, but Scarla's. 

The day the [[S4]] had arrived in [[New Orc City]], their actions at [[Orkrengrad]] led to the deactivation of all safety protocols in the [[Nail of Nortia]]. Earlier that very week, she had found out that her sister had been captured by people she thought were her allies. 

The lack of security protocols led to Linnaeus's [[dragonic whillo]] persona exerting its maximal [[Magic#Intent|aura]], which killed much of the staff in the building, threatened to tear it asunder, and desired to hunt down any remaining members of the Conspiracy, Amanita included. To that end, she was nearly turned to glass and pinned in a wall on the ninth floor, before being freed by, to her surprise, Serena, who blamed her for an incalculable number of sleights. ^791d05

Over the course of an incredibly emotionally eventful 15 minutes, Amanita quickly realized the horrors she'd committed against Serena and her line, not to mention against the Kingdom's people for apparently no reason at all. After much debate following their final battle with [[Arahabaki]], Amanita was left alone back at [[Farborough Manor]] by the S4.
