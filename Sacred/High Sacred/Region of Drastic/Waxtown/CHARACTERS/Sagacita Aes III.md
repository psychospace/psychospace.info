**Sagacita III**, known by her epithet of 'The Oracle', is the overseer and owner of the [[Waxcutter Library]]. A wise adult high elven woman with five eyes, each of different color, 'Cita' is the lady-mayor of [[Waxtown]] per the ancient words of the *Treaty of the River Cera*, signed by Brachi Arkaeo Falknjir and Sagacita I in the year [[775 PT]].

Sagacita's silvery hair, streaked with surviving strands of its original blue color, is proof of her age. Born in [[871 PT]] during the reign of Erlik Falk Paraves, she is 379 years old: extremely old by most metrics, but young at heart and only near half-way through her lifespan. With her many years she has spent her time accumulating a collection of the rarest and most important tomes, operating in the background of politics through subtle pushing of pieces to orchestrate peace at choice turns.

Whereas her grandmother Sagacita I died in an adventure after having served the Waxcutter Library her whole life, and her mother Sagacita II died in the rampage wrought by [[Janen Dino|the Kingclaw]], Sagacita III has remained careful and quiet throughout her time as the overseer, only seeking peace for the realms and knowledge for her own at any possible turn without harming herself.

Her spies, known as her 'Fireflies', are identified by their use of thaumaturgy as a color code, flashing each of the eye colors of Sagacita III in a specific pattern calculated using the date and the moons' cycles as a cipher.
