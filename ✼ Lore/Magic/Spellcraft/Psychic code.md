**[[Psionics|Psychic]] code** refers to mortal comprehension and study of the [[Divine Equation]], composed of tracts which embody certain aspects, intentions, or domains analogous to natural laws. Code is written and spoken either in [[Arckan]] or one of its derivations, such as [[Oa'Rovi]]. 

When written code is combined, it forms the baseline of [[Magic#Cast|cast magic]], although it is most often utilized by arcane casters. Psychic code can also be written "into" objects, creating [[enchanted items]].

Psychic code is [[Compilation|compiled]] by casters or their beneficiaries into repeatable, practicable sequences known asÂ [[Spell|spells]].
