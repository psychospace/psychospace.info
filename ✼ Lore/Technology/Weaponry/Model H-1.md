The **Model H-1** is a [[Firearm|firearm]] platform developed by [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] based on [[Homecoming]]. After [[Serena Nortia]] fielded the weapon with great success, [[NIMROD]] began developing the new Model H line of marksman rifles. The Model H-1 is the first and currently only weapon in the line. While not standard issue, it is a common gun seen throughout the [[Army of Euphony]] given to those who have proven proficiency in long range accurate shooting.

Its design closely mimics Homecoming with a few significant changes. First, it is made with significantly cheaper materials and manufacturing processes, opting for stamped sheet metal. Second, the use of storm magic to fire the projectile has been replaced with a conventional cartridge bullet mechanism. As such, the fired projectile is significantly smaller and weaker than Homecoming's. Third, the fixed axe head is replaced with a mounting point which can be affixed with a bipod, bayonet, or another axe head.
