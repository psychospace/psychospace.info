**Rosewire "Ms. Piano" Abatah** was a mysterious [[infiltration golem]] with a steel armature, who was always carrying around a case of some kind. Her voice was as if produced by a piano detuned, giving her the nickname of "Ms. Piano". The more refined assistant of the hag [[Mother Material]], she helps her master keep eyes on the world. She was a member of the elite [[Gold Clock Society]] in The Well, acting as its ambassador to other factions while having her primary alliance be that of the hag's.

She often fought with a longbow, seeing it as a refined weapon for an assassin. If an enemy came in close, she'd brandish words first, then stab you in the back with her fool's gold dagger, infamously nicknamed "The Worst".

In her spare time, she crafted small dolls of other characters, in particular her enemies, using them to try and predict the events to befall her in the future. A rumor went that if you find a doll of yourself, you had best suck up to her and apologize for whatever you did, or you're going to be found dead in a ditch within a few weeks.

The case contains a number of repair parts for her body, which is that of an ancient wooden and ivory golem constructed by [[Shinedown]], which was then found, repaired, and put to work by Mother Material. When Abatah must find a more subtle way around, she puts one of her other "faces" on, literally: her armature is that of an infiltration golem, capable of changing its face and its outfit rapidly with magic.

When she battled the [[S4]] in [[1251 PT]], after discovering [[Arthur Graywell]]'s [[Primal curse|lycanthropy]], she failed to assassinate him and was decommissioned. At the behest of [[Cyrano Paige Tourneur]], her parts were surrendered to the party as part of rooting out internal corruption in the Society. 

With those parts, [[N.E.K.O.]] was created.
