A **sophist** is a [[Broadcaster]] able to share their particular abilities with others: most distinctively their [[Codec]]. Extending beyond creating a tool and then allowing someone else to wield it, a Sophist can "teach" others minor forms of the abilities they've innately understood, allowing almost anyone to perceive at least fragmentary elements of [[The Signal]].

Not every Broadcaster has this ability.
