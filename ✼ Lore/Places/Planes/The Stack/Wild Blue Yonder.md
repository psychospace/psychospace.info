The **Wild Blue Yonder** is the colloquial term for the [[Plane#realm|realm]] of influence of non-elemental mortals and [[Immortal|immortals]] on the [[The Planet]]. It is the largest layer of the planar stack and the primary subject matter of most of [[✼ Psychospace.info|this wiki]]. 

Amid blue [[Skysea|sky oceans]] that undergo processes and patterns of [[Weather]], [[Remnant|remnants]] act as the canvas on which civilizations are painted.

The Yonder also encompasses each "plane" on the [[Flipside]] of each remnant.
