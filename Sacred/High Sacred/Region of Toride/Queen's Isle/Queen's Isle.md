An island has, for as long as recorded history, settled in the outlying [[Skysea]] of northwest [[High Sacred]]. In ancient times it was known as *Isola dei Santuari*, the Isle of Shrines, as it was used as a holy site of pilgrimage for the high priests of the [[Carapa Republic]], who were capable of flight. They believed it was a holy place because only they and the angels they worshipped were worthy enough to have the honor of walking there. It was said to be "the god's watchpoint", since the center of the island was marked by a tall, thin mountain known today as the **Horn of Sacred**, which looked to them like a sort of peeking tower above the horizon.

However, after [[Plesio Falknjir]] took over the land of Sacred, the first Queen of the Kingdom, Lady [[Brachi Falknjir]], claimed the island for herself, using it as a meeting spot to broker peace between various realms, including Low Sacred. After the Falknjir line transformed into the Dino lineage, the island's native creatures started to reclaim the old ruins as texts about the islands' uses and ancient purposes started to fall into myth.

It wasn't until around [[1000 PT]] that [[Victory Starscouts]] were again sent to the region to map the island, during the time when northern expansionism had taken High Sacred by storm. By the time of the reign of [[Spino Dino]], the Starscouts in the region had successfully uncovered the ruins, reclaimed a part of the island, and were prepared to send various [[Sacred Royal Ultra|Royal Ultra]] to study the island and preserve it. Spino did as much, and the remnant learned much about its smaller neighbor.

[[Megal Triassa]], searching through ancient texts, discovered the original purposes of the island, and reclaimed it once again in these studies, taking specific interest in how the original inhabitants of the island seemed to revere the footsteps of angels.

As one of her final decrees as queen consort of Sacred, following even her son [[Eusar Dino|Eusar]]'s transformation and subsequent death, Megal ordered that the Isle be used as a resort and research center, especially when tourism and research is coordinated across remnants.
