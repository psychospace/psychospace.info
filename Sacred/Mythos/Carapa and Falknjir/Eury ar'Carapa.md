Grand Premier **Eury ar'Carapa** was the [[evangel]] founder and first premier of the [[Carapa Republic]]. Initially a religious figure, it led the unification of the [[High Sacred|Carpaean]] tribes of the modern day Region of [[Drastic]], forming the first iteration of the republic in [[39 PT]].

It is unknown what Eury's original name was, as upon ascension the family name was replaced with "ar'Carapa", a rough [[Oa'Rovi]] term for "true nature of the tenets of kinship", best translated as something like "Super-Tribal Leader". It is said that Eury [[Succession (ability)|succeeded]] an [[angel]]'s soul, and believed that it's domain would thusly last forever.

Eury's mortal [[body]] passed away in [[107 PT]], and its soul was succeeded by [[Picche ar'Carapa]].
