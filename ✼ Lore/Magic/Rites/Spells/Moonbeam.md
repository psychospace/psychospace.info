***Moonbeam*** is a [[spell]] of low-level [[Arcane complexity|complexity]]. 

A force of [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]] aligned with the [[Dark Sea]], the spell calls down a silvery beam of [[Vitality energy|positive]] and [[Void energy|negative]] energy which manifests as an impact on [[Light (property)|localized Light levels]]. This causes the [[air]] nearby to burn with divine intent, inducing a false emotion which causes shapechangers to have their true form unleashed.

Similar to material light, the light of a *moonbeam* can't be resisted: the radiance must be defended against.

>[[Ink of Angelblood|One]] of the [[Nortian Conspiracy|cloaked figures]] pulls out a short [[Life Line|yellow blade]] and holds it skyward. A flash of light, miniscule and yet fast, shoots from the top of this blade into the clouds. A shining black flame with white fringe, starts shining outward from the top of the stadium.

>A massive thumping, ominous noise can be heard from the sky as [[Hazel Sobol|Hazel]] holds a limp, fight-less [[Lazuli Dino|Linnaeus]] skyward with one mighty arm. The clouds part and from on high, a pillar of radiant white light envelops Hazel and Linnie. The crowd gasps. The dullahan's armor cracks and shudders revealing more layers of black, as she she yowls in pleasure, while Linnie's body suddenly bursts outward with orange and yellow energy, as [[Ildy]]'s final protective barrier breaks and bursts like a rubber suit inflating and popping.
