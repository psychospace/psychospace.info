**Orkrengrad** (Оркренград), the **City of Orchestration**, is a legendary ancient city and dungeon located at the heart of [[New Orc City]]. It was initially constructed to confine and protect [[Uforia]], and is an immensely holy site to the [[Temple of the Uforiad]]. Nobody who lives has ever found the host at its core.

# History
To ensure Uforia's slumber and protect the land from a foretold [[Dizforia|devastation]], [[Valerian]] distorted the landscape around Uforia's [[Phantasm]], protecting her from incursion.

Eventually, when [[Great Nortian Empire#The Coalescence|the Coalescence]] occurred, Valerian aided his new people in the construction of the city on the distorted landscape. Over time, this city came to partly flit into [[Psychospace]], making it larger on the inside.

# Contents
Through her placement here, the [[The Abyss|Abyssal]] layer of [[Tantalus]] was effectively shut out from influence over the obverse side, so long as the people of the Empire keep the faith. Mortals protected by Uforia’s aegis were able to battle demons and live to tell the tale, including the imperial lineage. 

Orkrengrad contains many dangerous traps.
