The **Scarlet Skies** are a layer of [[The Heavens]] which act as the land of the [[Death|dead]] and the [[Fiend|fiends]] who control them, situated below the [[Wild Blue Yonder]]. They are also the axiomatic plane of [[Elemental energy|elemental]] fire. Occupied by their own [[Remnant|remnants]] called **Hells**, the [[Flipside|flipsides]] of these remnants comprise [[The Abyss]].

Nine layers of clouds and winds progress further and further into hot, hot sunset, into cold dusk, into dooming night. The weight of the world weighs especially heavy here. A [[Soul]] who falls through the Wild Blue Yonder with no protection will burn up and be sent unto death.

A hell known as [[Unwri]] is notable for being the place where souls are sorted into their individual afterlives.
