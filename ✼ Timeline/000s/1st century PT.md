[[BPT 0]] < [[0 PT]] > [[1 PT]] >> [[2nd century PT]] 

At the turn of the epoch, tired of the difficulty of the [[Scaled Purge]], gnomish peoples of [[Dawndust]] used their accord with nature to craft the first artificial cores. As it turned out, [[Phantasm|phantasms]] are generated by and themselves generate a particular kind of 'willpower', not unlike a [[Dragon]]'s soul aspects, which combined with the [[Gray Waters]] could coagulate [[Vibe]] into consciousnesses. 

In their deepest set workshops within [[Mount Oriye]], the gnomish artificers created [[Core engine|cores]] without the need for hunts. This was to such a successful degree that the holy Gray Waters were partly [[Channel of Aktomos|diverted into the mountain]], at great cost. 

Around the turn of the epoch, [[Airship|airships]] propogate, an invention of Dawndust who discovered the ability to reliably create them in [[BPT 50]]. At the same time, this diplomacy begins to spread the belief about [[Pantheon of Dawndust|major and minor gods]].
