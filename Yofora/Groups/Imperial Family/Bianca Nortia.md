**Bianca Arize Mezeyad Nortia**^[Бьянка Аризе Мезеяд Нортиа] was a [[human]]-[[aasimar]] [[Empress of Nortia|empress]] of the [[Great Nortian Empire]]. The mother of [[Serena Nortia|Serena]], [[Iosif Nortia|Iosif]], [[Leonid Nortia|Leonid]], and [[Lidiya Nortia|Lidiya]], she was known for her magical prowess, leading her country through the dangers of the late [[War of the Masters]].

As with all of her line, she possessed the ability of [[monism]]. She was well-loved by her people.

# History

Bianca was born in [[Samíx]] in [[1156 PT]], to the Empress [[Katherin Nortia]] and the great trade-lord [[Ivan Telmyk]], the latter of whom was given a Uforian premonition that the location would be portentous. As a member of the [[Nortian imperial family]], she held a high responsibility even from an early age.

The area's magical energy is said to have contributed to Bianca's eventual natural high control over [[The Sheer|the Sheer]]. Through her assistance, Nortian magicians were able to find how to wield a limited form of the Sheer as well in the form of technology, through [[Runic engine|runic engines]].

Early in her life, she became betrothed to and married [[Konstantin Nortia|Konstantin Dorokhov]]. On the Nones of Arkea, [[1205 PT]], her first daughter [[Serena Nortia]] was born, and immediately became her [[Successor (Nortia)|Successor]]. With the advancements made in [[Firearm|firearms]], Bianca had a weapon commissioned for this occasion, known as [[Homecoming]]. 

Her first son, [[Iosif Nortia]], was born in [[1207 PT]], shortly after Konstantin perished in a battle during the late [[War of the Masters]]. Her second set of children, [[Leonid Nortia|Leonid]] and [[Lidiya Nortia]], were born in [[1227 PT]] as a result of a fling with family-friend [[Semyon Oliynyk]].

## Dragonic War
When she was around 94, in [[1250 PT]], her [[soul]] suddenly became unreachable for reasons unknown, inciting [[Illarion Parasom]] to [[Nortian Conspiracy|take over]]. In total, her existence was severely damaged by a process that left her form and abilities superseded by the [[tzitzimitl]] entity [[Scarla Nitrum]]. This caused monism towards her to become cut off, as [[Ekaitz]] apparently fractured within her. 

While in such a difficult state, the [[Red Spark]] kicked off the [[Dragonic War]]. Through the mire of being locked away inside her own body, through Scarla meeting with scientists studying [[Arahabaki]], she was able to have audience with Arahabaki's [[Dragonic curse|host]], [[Lazuli Dino|Linnie Dino]], using [[telepathy]]. Through Linnie, she was able to keep both their spirits high, despite the damage both were suffering; and after Linnie was [[Zero Day|rescued]], that message of resoluteness and preparedness to commit to her duty passed to [[Serena Nortia]], for whom it was intended.

Eventually, her body-as-a-weapon was used for the final encounter with the [[S4]], an encounter which resulted in Scarla's ultimate failure. Bianca remained comatose -- ostensibly alive, but her soul could not fully recover. After a visit to [[Uforia]] convinced Serena of this frustrating state, Bianca's soul agreed to remain on Uforia's beachbound dream, and with the new empress as an accent and permanent friend to her [[fylgja]]-aspect of Ekaitz. 

Some say that whenever Homecoming is fired now, its bullets are guided by Bianca's voice, even to this day.
