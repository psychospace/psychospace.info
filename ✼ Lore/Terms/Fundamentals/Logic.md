In the context of [[magic]], **logic**, sometimes called **fate**, **chance**, or **destiny**, is the term used to describe chance and potential as manifestations of cause and effect. Along with [[chaos]] and [[gravity]], logic forms one of the fundamental forces of [[The Heavens]].

Observed by [[Divination|diviners]], logic is a measurable, cogent force for change, and something that is being understood more and more as interlinked with a [[creature]]'s typical [[Viewpoint property|viewpoint]]. It is otherwise invisible, implacable, untouchable and inconceivable.

# Principles

This force acts invisibly yet persistently in [[psychospace]], driven by chaos, nurtured by [causality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality), and informed by free will.  Logic is best defined as chaos "making a decision", or "settling its bets". By its existence, logic is the conspiracy that pulls everything along: if something is meant to happen, it will be logic that, one way or another, makes it so. 

Logic concerning [[time travel]] is highly enforced by self-consistency, and all actions by time travelers merely work to fulfill history.

Logic is often called the base element of the [[Divine Equation]], and breaching it or invalidating prior steps in it can cause severe [[Curse|curses]] to come about. 

# Guidance of logic
Logic can be manipulated under certain conditions.

Those who can consciously or unconsciously guide logic will find themselves with an inordinate amount of luck. Those who are aware of their binds to the grand motivator (and who can exploit it to their advantage) will consistently find themselves prepared for ongoing events and the tendency of the world, though logic does not necessarily impact the future. 

In addition, those with a lack of a bind to the grand motivator, such as those without a [[fylgja]], will find that they tend to become a point around which other events "orbit".
