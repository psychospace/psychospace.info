A **monitor** is a broad term which refers to [[Immortal|immortals]] that field a more neutral gamut of responsibilities. Primarily, they are the "monitors" of rules, laws, and transitions, be they the various thresholds between the [[Plane|planes]] or the more metaphorical thresholds crossed during processes like inventing, dreaming, time passing, or [[Death|death]]. 

Some style themselves also as **aeons**, who protect and observe reality's conflicting aspects, or **axiomites**, who help refine concepts important to reality. The only monitor most are aware of are [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]], who oversee the flow of dead souls. However, well-known to those with powerful ties to [[Elemental creatures|elemental]] blood are also the [[protean|proteans]] of [[Chartless Sea]].

In accordance with their broader responsibilities, monitor [[Scion|scions]] are also wildly unique to one another. Sapient monitor scions include [[duskwalker|duskwalkers]], [[ganzi|ganzis]], and [[aphorite|aphorites]].
