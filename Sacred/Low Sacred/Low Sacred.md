**Low Sacred** is a [[Remnant]], technically one half of a single remnant shattered by the [[Breaking of Sacred]]. Its [[Flipside]] is [[the Beastlands]]. Its counterpart is [[High Sacred]].

Once touched by [[Unitor|unitors]], Low Sacred has been under control of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] since its founding.

She is split into three duchys:
- **Kyuna**, headquartered in [[Pendulum]].
- **Precipice**, headquartered in [[Ladybug]].
	- The [[Sorbet Islands]] are off the coast of Precipice.
- and **Finitum**, headquartered in [[Gateway]].
