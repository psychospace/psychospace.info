Although originally named for the famous [[Waxcutter Library]], the fabled city of **Waxtown** now features far more than just that.

This town, founded up the coast from [[Drastic]], harbors its roots in the [[Carapa Republic]]. Of the towns that existed at the time of Sacred's invasion, it remained one of the least changed by the shift in power. Rumors say that within the town, once named *Aeth'Cognit*, there was a sect of scholars who, under the guise of making peace and capitulating to [[Plesio Falknjir|the Bandit King]], secretly plotted against their new ruler.

Nowadays, Waxtown is an artist's paradise. Originally sitting in the shadow of the Library and the adjacent [[Castle Xilan]], following the advent of the [[Age of Adventurers]], Waxtown began to get very different clientele than the hermetic scholars who occupied the town previously. Seeing it instead as a stopover for those who begin their adventuring journeys east of Drastic, it became overpopulated in one season, who built out the town. A fandom grew the population further, after the tale of [[Junah Rollingstone]] was told throughout the city, who also lives here in his own keep, on [[Sharkbite Bluff]].

This town marks the eastern and northern bounds of the region of Drastic (for administrative purposes).
