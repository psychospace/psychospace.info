Potion-runners and manufacturers, **Phalanx L치ng** is a [[Changeling]] system who fled [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] during the close of the [[War of the Masters]]. They have no family name and no true first name, though legally their name is **Lyl L치ng**. Phalanx is a one-body security team and drug operation.

Phalanx is generally kind, despite their lines of work, though pissing them off is liable to end up with you waking up somewhere you don't recognize.
# History
They were born with DID after complications in pregnancy left their mother dead and themselves without breath for several days, before miraculously healing. It is believed by Dr. L치ng that their father was a [[Doppelganger]], hence the complete blank point that is their parentage. 

Phalanx was caught up in the [[Spider's Web]] for a time, a useful position given their product of illicit [[alchemy]], before retiring from that faction when [[Alexios Hawthorne]] murdered Solaria Evercleave, showing that rising the ranks and sticking by was not safe, especially if they had hopes only of survival and little ambitions else.

Hoping to turn over a new leaf, the collective took over a small fort in the woods near [[Y'viry]] around ten years ago, using it as a laboratory while selling locally. When it was suspected that Phalanx had abandoned the Web as opposed to retirement, assassins were sent after them, which they endure to this day, using their myriad allies' knowledge, as well as their own, to help them fend off.
# Alters
Phalanx is plural: the name refers to the collective, and was given to them by [[Solaria Evercleave]]. Six of seven alters exist to surround and protect one, Dr. L치ng, an alchemist, hence their namesake being akin to a secure formation of soldiers.
