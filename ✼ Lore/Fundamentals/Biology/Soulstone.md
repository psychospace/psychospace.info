A **soulstone** is any crystal, natural or artificial, which is capable of holding a [[Soul|soul]]. These crystals are usually [[Chaos|chaotic]] in origin and composition, owing to their ability to withhold a vast amount of [[Echo|echoes]]. Examples include [[Heart container|heart containers]] and [[quasidragon|quasidragons]].

The magical study of [[marmarancy]] studies how to bind a soul to such a vessel, as well as how to create one. Crystallized ichor also turns into soulstones, such as those created mythologically by the body of [[Mynos]] which turned into [[Gebra]].
