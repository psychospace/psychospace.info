**Arnecca** is a major city at the foot of [[Mount Sokron]], and the historical founding capitol of the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]]. As one of the territory's largest cities, it has come to be viewed as one of the most vibrant and opportunity-rich places on the remnant, next to its sister-city [[Eleyda]].

It is known ceremonially as "the [[Bullion#Miracle City|Miracle City]] of the Seedling Lands", for it is said long after the land was upturned by erosion, a single seed survived, proving to those who came after [[Ith'Paraan]] that the land was not lifeless or hopeless. As a result of its history, it is one of the oldest standing cities on Bullion, no doubt also due to its position at the conflux of the [[Ithika River Valley]].

It was the site of the [[First Institute]], founded by [[Camillo Ponderosa]] and [[Kolin Summers]], though when that burned down the [[Second Institute]] was constructed elsewhere.

Its eidolon is [[Joli]], embodiment of opportunity.
