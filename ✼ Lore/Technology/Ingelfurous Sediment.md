**Ingelfurous Sediment**^[(ihn - jel - for - ous)], shortened to "ingel", is a construction material invented by [[Diesterthan Materials|Diesterthan Materials GmbH.]] used mainly in the [[Scarlet Skies]]. 

After creation, it is a sort of liquid rock that can be poured to fill molds or holes. It is most commonly used to create building foundations, but can be generally used for many other applications.

It contains aggregate dirt, sand, rocks, and other mining byproducts ground to a certain uniform grit and suspended in a liquid. Once mixed, it stays in solution for years if kept in an airtight container. If poorly kept, it dries out in a few weeks. To harden it, a second chemical activator is mixed during the pouring of the ingel, causing it to harden over a few days. The final result is a single large block of "stone" with a semi-glossy exterior.
