The **House of Horrors** are a group of [[Primal curse|lycanthrope]] privateers who mostly operate off of one vessel, a custom [[Archipel]] treasure-trawler known as the [[Handlubber II]]. 

# History
The group was founded by [[Hull Gunnarsson|Hubert "Hull" Gunnarsson]] of [[Archipel]] during the [[War of the Masters]]. A man of the seas, both air and water, Hull was never far from the deck of a vessel for his entire life, mythologized as son of a pirate king and mermaid. Under the employ of the [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]]-aligned trade prince [[Kamikatsu Fukushiza]], Hull met his husband, and received an intriguing variant of the [[curse]] from a chance encounter, becoming a wereshark.

After the war, the pair continued their employ with Fukushiza-dono, eventually taking on [[Tiny Horror|Tinnitro]], an orphan stowaway who wanted to train and become a hero, anointed Hull's apprentice. The crew of the original Handlubber would find themselves hunting down rogue elements that emerged in the wake of the war, which Tinnitro sometimes had qualms over, and during which they would often need to make landing on shore. During one landing, they found themselves met with [[Reala Horror|Reala]], a clan-outcast huntress who taught each of them how to use their curse, their blood, as a bargaining chip against bounties: keeping track of them for whoever was bidding, often burdening them with guilt. Thus the ship's crew became something more of a family bound by their shared curse, and all these years since, this small privateering crew has evolved into what it is today.

## Current Affairs
Tinnitro "Tiny" Horror now captains the vessel.
