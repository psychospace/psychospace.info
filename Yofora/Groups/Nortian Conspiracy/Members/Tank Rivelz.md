**Tank Rivelz** was a half-[[orc]] battlemaster who was allied with [[Nortian Conspiracy|the Conspiracy]], and leader of [[Special Task Force Undergarden]]. 

Originally a [[Umazia|Umazian]] slave whose name was reduced to numbers, he emerged victorious from the fighting pits and stole the names of his competitors.

Like all of the Conspirators, Tank normally wears the [[Cloak of Excelsio]].

Tank wields the Sightstone Halberd. The weapon was formed of an astral material known as [[sightstone]], which can vanish between objects into nothingness, and emerge from an impossible space in a moment, likely surprising its foes.
