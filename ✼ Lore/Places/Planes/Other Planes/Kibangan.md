**Kibangan** ("bedrock" in [[Draconic]]), sometimes called the **firmament**, is a [[Plane#Pyrean|pyrean plane]] of raw [[Magic|magic]]. Kibangan is the source of [[Psychospace|psychospace]], which is a three-dimensional shadow of the firmament's fourth-dimensional existence, cast by the influence of [[Cien]].

Existing fourth-dimensionally as an object within [[Out There|outer space]], subverting the limits of "physical" space, most know its influence [[Phantasm|splits]] each [[Remnant|remnant]] in [[Flipside|two]]. Within Kibangan, [[Gravity]] and the rules of reality are somewhat in flux. It is also the source of [[The Sheer|the Sheer]] and [[The Fortress|the Fortress]], derivations associated with it.

This plane is the origin of [[Fey|fey]], and has a physical form beyond its natural purpose as a crossing point, but this physical form is sufficiently different to the geometry and comprehensibility of [[The Heavens|the Heavens]]. 

[[Death]] means very little inside Kibangan. If a [[Petitioner|petitioner]] is ever sent here, it will immediately reincarnate into a fey creature with that petitioner's mortal personality.

It is rumored that [[Welkin]] where the [[Divinity|gods]] dwell is somewhere within. At the very least, it is accepted that the gods came from [[Chartless Sea]], which may have birthed Kibangan.
