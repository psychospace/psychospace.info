**Alpoa-Derya wyrms**, called **scribe adders**, are serpentine [[Elemental creatures#Titan|titan elementals]] of the [[earth]]. Their hides are largely hunted for use in [[train|trains]], owing to their miraculous physical properties.

Their name comes from the people of the [[Alpoa Plateau|Alpoa]] and [[Derya Plateau|Derya]] plateaus, geographic regions of [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qaulhain]], where in ancient times the creatures once nested in the hundreds, as attested to by [[Holrfold]]. The dwarves of Holrfold believed the creatures to be limbs of [[Nárjǫrð]].

# Physiology
Like their fellow serpents, they are immense [[Creature|creatures]] with lengthy [[Body|bodies]], whose connection to their element has a powerful effect on their own physiology. Adders particularly dwell within [[remnant|remnants]] on many layers, consistently disturbing earth in their migratory path, though preferring to go undisturbed in the remote regions of many [[Flipside|flipsides]] or [[the Below]].

A single segment of its body can be anywhere from 10m to 25m in length, with the median length usually getting longer near the midsection. Wyrms on average are composed of about 25 of these segments, giving the species an average length of about 450m. A wyrm at rest is almost totally camouflaged by its appearance, and its sight is primarily perceived through microscopic changes in atmospheric pressure and [[Gravity|gravitational]] force.

Within its maw, an adder is capable of channeling electrical and arcane potential stored in the crystals in its body to churn and sublimate various forms of earth into glass or ash. It rarely uses this ability to process the earth, but will do so when under duress. One can tell the placement of the hunting grounds of an adder through tunnels made of sheer, flat surfaces of shoddy yellow glass.

# Behavior

## Life stages

Adders are a mature form of [[Scribe moth|scribe moths]], though the moths rarely assume this form and thus adders are rarely born. The moths mine out spaces for immense webs where they form phantasmal gates and subsequently pupate for around a month. The hatching of an adder causes a seismic disturbance in the region above it. 

Once hatched, adders slowly grow to their full length over the course of about a decade, and an adder has never been seen to die of age.

## Sustenance
Adders absorb the food they need to sustain themselves from the earth around them through their glassy, long abdominal segments. Using their maws, they tunnel by consistently eating earth and then removing things like water, nutrients, and minerals before excreting the raw dirt left behind from their feasting. Adders are known to upheave the earth if it is significantly heavy and in their way, but, due to their energy needs and immense size, they do not like to waste energy in this manner.

When an adder rests after a hunt, it prefers to do so inside a [[phantasm]] it creates, just like the scribe moths that give birth to it. If its rest is disturbed, it will immediately attempt to surface in order to reorient itself.

The tastiest prey to an adder is various potentious organic isotopes, such as those found in ash, corpses, coal, or diamonds. For adders, nourishment is less about raw energy and more about taste. An adder given a diamond ring to devour can and will rest for about a [[Year (unit)|year]] without hunting anything else.

An adder much prefers retreat to [[death]], as even if it succumbs to its wounds, its body will be closer to any young, who can then consume it in a cycle.
# Hunting
Though sometimes boldly hunted for the elements it has consumed, the carapace which covers the adder's enormous length, its armor, is what adders are primarily hunted for. 

Adders are capable of shedding their armor in chunks when they believe they are significantly threatened: without their armor, they are significantly more mobile, and significantly more passive in their patterns of attack. Adders generally rest in order to regrow their carapace, so they can reliably be found moving about when it can be harvested again.

The armor of an adder is flexible, hardy to prolonged use, and extremely resilient to heavy impacts, making it ideal for industrial uses, such as trains. The material is similar to a toughened reinforced glass, and falls off the creature in distinct cleaved sub-segments, sometimes characterized as "brackets", able to be moved and reconstructed. 

However, the armor is highly scratchable and, if bent or worked beyond limit, will shatter into mostly useless biodegradable fragments, in what is characterized as a wet and extremely messy manner, making it unideal for body armor outside of plating, or weaponry outside of ammunition.
