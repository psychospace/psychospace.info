The **Silver Coin Shell** is a simple canister round designed to be fired from a ship mounted cannon. It is a shell packed with standard mint silver coins instead of more conventional projectiles like ball bearings or lead slugs. While strange in nature, it was often employed by [[Diesterthan Materials|Diesterthan Materials GmbH.]] as a stop-gap measure when the logistics chain could not supply enough silvered projectiles.
