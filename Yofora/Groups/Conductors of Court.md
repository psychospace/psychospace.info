The **Conductors of Court** are the high imperial legislature of [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]], overseen by the position of the **[[Lord of Law]]**, presently [[Illarion Parasom]] and usually one of House Parasom. 

The Conductors keep records and laws under watch and in enforcement. It is widely believed by the populace that the [[Eyes of Uforia]] are instruments of the Conductors.

# Duties
The Conductors act as intermediaries from the [[Nortian imperial family|imperial family]] to the empire's courts. These nobles should hold the interests of the entire empire when concerning themselves with law, though they are widely influenced by faith in [[Uforia]]'s kin. Whenever imperial crimes must be heard, it is the Conductors who must hear the cases before delivering their cases to the Lord of Law to pass a judgement.

# Membership
Staffed by nobility selected by the empress herself from the [[Cradling Hand]] and other factions from around the empire, Many noble families already in the Conductors of Court highly prize education as a necessity for growing up, as the empress is more likely to elect a new candidate from families already in the Court. Afforded the noble title of princess or prince, Conductors of Court enjoy some diplomatic immunity, though a hefty indictment will still result in a stripping of rank.
