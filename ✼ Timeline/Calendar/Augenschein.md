**Augenschein** ("theophany" or "appearance") is a yearly period of five [[Starfall|starfalls]] at the end of the year where the moons hang nearly static, next to one another, in the sky. 

Augenschein and the [[Staff of Augen]] is named for the appearance of the moons, which mimics the arrival in the myths of [[Lex|twin]] [[Lex|deities]] that judge the world from on high. Whichever moon becomes the brightest by the time Augenschein is over is said to portend the year's events.

When the [[Staff of Augen]] in [[Pinwheel]]'s capitol of [[Blure]] is struck by the morning rays most, a new year will have begun.
