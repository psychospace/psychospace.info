**Psychospace** (/saɪ̯.koʊ̯.speɪs/ <small><i>sy-KOH-spayse</i></small>) is a [[Plane#Sphere|plane]] of existence which parallels and exists alongside the [[Plane#Realm|physical world]], effecting and affected by thoughts and ideas of [[Soul|souls]]. Its existence defines [[The Heavens|the Heavens]].

From psychospace, driven by the [[logic]] of the [[Divine Equation]], all [[magic]] is given power, and all souls are granted agency. 

The adjective form of psychospace is _psychospacial_ (_sy-KOH-SPAY-shul_). Study of psychospacial nature is known as [[psionics]], and those borne from psychospace are called [[Figment|figments]].

# Properties
Instead of [[air]], psychospace is comprised of [[Vibe]], which changes and affects ambient emotions and intentions. Through it, psychospace experiences common patterns of energy referred to as as [[Off-wave|off-waves]].

The plane resembles the "outside world", but distorted, overblown, and driven by the conscious minds of those within and around it. 

Blue in the horizon bends towards a sickly pink and teal, while the dark of the night turns purple and scarlet. Colors twist and glow, the light seems unnaturally perfect, geography warps and builds amid multicolored [[Cloudscape|cloud]], mundane architecture and art somehow gain delirious awe-inspiring qualities, and the [[weather]] seems fickle and bent to your will. 

The unseen and ethereal call this plane home, best described as the meeting point between dreams and reality: astral megafauna might leap over distant scenery, [[fish]] soaring from lake to lake, whilst fading [[Echo|echoes]] can still be heard in passing conversation, as though the thoughts that bore them dwell here still.

Were it to vanish, a state known as a [[TPK|total psychospace kill]], mass devastation would occur, as logic's [[Collapse state|collapse]] would force all [[Phantasm|phantasms]] simultaneously to corrupt and vanish.

# Origin
The plane itself is a three-dimensional shadow created by the [[Plane#Pyrean|pyrean]] [[Kibangan|firmament]], cast by the light of the [[star]] [[Cien]]. As such, it can be accessed not only on [[the Planet]], where it is most potent, but anywhere in the [[Antic Sea]].

Psychospace borders so closely on the Heavens, through its all-encompassing nature, that its connection is shaky enough to sometimes perceive from within a [[Plane#Realm|physical realm]], a talent known as *[[senzai]]*.
