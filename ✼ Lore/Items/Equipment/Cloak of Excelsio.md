The **cloak of excelsio** is an enchanted black mantle made of [[silixium|silix]] leather, capable of greatly enhancing the user's agility and ferocity. It also obscures the face, but it does not obscure the body type and size. It became the unsavory symbol of the [[Nortian Conspiracy]].

Its primary function is to allow the user to escape from situations and combat, enabling them to both surprise and deny their enemies ground.

Upon [[death|death]] while wearing the cloak, it burns to ash. However, if the user does not truly die, then the cloak melts instead.

>>*Wondrous item, must be attuned*
>>
>>While wearing this cloak, when you take 5 hits (or one attack which would strike your body at five or more separate points, like on the fringe range of a *fireball*) of any type before the end of your next turn, you can use your reaction to use the cape's building magic to "break" out of any combo attack you appear to be stuck in. This is not silent: the cape erupts into odd-colored flames until the end of the current turn.
>>
>>After you use this reaction, you become immune to all damage from the creature whose turn it is until the end of their turn, suddenly glowing with a raging light. As part of this reaction, you can then use any action, but using anything except Dash, Dodge, or Disengage causes you to lose use of your action at the start of your next turn.
>>
>>Using the Dash action allows you to move up to your movement speed in any direction. Dodge and Disengage allow you to move half your movement speed.
>>
>>If your reaction is cut short by the reaction of another character (for example, if the fifth attack is synched with a reaction spell cast by another creature), you can't use a normal action afterward.
