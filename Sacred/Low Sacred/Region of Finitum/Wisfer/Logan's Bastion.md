In the Silverfields north of [[Wisfer]], there was once a mad lord whose castle now lies dead center between the bickering lords. The mad lord of old was an artificer human named [[Logan Caruso]], who was said to have built vaults so deep they open to the [[Scarlet Skies]] by reaching [[the Beastlands]]. 

The bastion fell to ruin over the ages as the skeletons Logan built there kept rebelling, and he spent more and more time on the other coast in [[Shero's Reach]], at that time called [[Installation S.H.O.R.E.]] The bastion was heavily fortified, protected by a veritable army of skeletons, but was in an absolutely awful position if it were ever attacked, lying dead in the middle of a valley where it could be attacked on all sides. This led it to not be taken, as it was otherwise lying off the roads. This tracked, as although Logan began work on the bastion as an ancestral fort, it became a laboratory, and thus the need for sprawling guard walls lessened.

It would take eons as the keep fell into disrepair for a motivated wizard to bother attacking the fort and uncover the wealth of knowledge within. This wizard was known as Doctor Rodgers Billion, an orphan with a corny name he gave himself and early graduate of the [[Constellar School]] eager to make his mark on the world and start from Caruso's stopping point. Here he made his impact on the local community, becoming the town creep: hawking potions and unhelpful advice to the adventurers seeking him out. But somewhere along the line, adventurers seeking him out were met with locked doors, no funny character he would put on, nor even the man himself (as he would occasionally appear in public when his foodstores ran low).

All that was left was a keep heavily fortified, and adventurers leaving as quickly as they came in, assaulted by visions of eyes.
