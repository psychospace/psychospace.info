>>Prince [[Lazuli Dino|Linnaeus]] as a dragonic whillo.<br> Art by [[âœ¼ World Credits#^4926d3|forbiddentaako]].

When the [[Dragonic Curse]] fully manifested, the one afflicted becomes a [[Creature|creature]] known as a **dragonic whillo**: a twisted, [[dragon]]-like creature of immense power. This being, too concerned with its own plots, cannot lead a nation and gains great power each time it surfaces. The only person to have ever survived transforming into it was the last to bear the curse, [[Lazuli Dino]].

A whillo inherits much of its original host's mind and sources of strength. The metamorphosis is slow, and difficult to predict the progression of.

A dragonic whillo automatically acts and attacks in response to the cursed host's enemies, including any it could make or does make. This results in grave destruction, without potential for recourse.

As a result of its immense power, [[detect magic]] fails to detect anything except a pure "[[The Signal|signal]]".
