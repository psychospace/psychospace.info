>[!quote | author] *Hymn of the [[First Magicians|First Ones]]*, **Athemat**, Verse 11-18
>
>11. Where [[Anti|the newborn titan]] walked, there were [[Dragon|dragons]] born of the displaced earth, adrift, free of the shackles of the world as it once was, free to make up the world as it would be.
>
>12. As the Ignition thought, its thoughts took wing: these imbued the lands with the willpower to exert freedom from [[Chaos]], the willpower to assume a shape in the [[Context|real]].
>
>13. The Ignition Point's travels through the nothing-world spread its perspective, a blazing fire of identity, turning it into [[The Heavens|a place of heavenly ideal]]. 
>
>14. The land blessed by its steps became the [[Remnant|pieces left behind]], and the creatures borne of the land would be their masters. [[Logic]] began to return as the world learned its bounds and its natures.
>
>15. The [[Kibangan|realm of bedrock and potential]] assembled as the world learned, to protect itself from the [[Chartless Sea|realm of madness and energy]]. After all, that place had once torn [[Old world|the world]] apart, stone by inglorious stone.
>
>16. As the bedrock became more and more solid, so too did its embrace grow around the world. This love filled the stones with [[Psychospace|meaning]], with perception, and finally with life. 
>
>17. The [[Echo|remembered world]] resonated with this embrace, the further and further the titan traveled. 
>
>18. Thus did the titan depart the lands, to allow the memories to take shape, and to carve out [[Welkin|a place of safety]], so that this world would not be alone.
