In [[Pinwheel Tempo]], a **month** or a **moon** is a period of thirty [[Starfall|starfalls]]. These are generally aligned with the cycles of the [[Lex|twin]] [[Ordo|moons]]. Each [[Year (unit)|year]] is comprised of twelve months, followed by [[Augenschein]].

# Names
The months are named as follows:
1. [[Ersta]]
2. [[Wote]]
3. [[Terze]]
4. [[Vire]]
5. [[Unfata]]
6. [[Alssad]]
7. [[Sabela]]
8. [[Arkea]]
9. [[Neun]]
10. [[Zanneter]]
11. [[Annaher]]
12. [[Gewalt]]
# Principal Dates
Each month is comprised of three principal dates: the **Kalends**, the **Nones**, and the **Ides**, as well as the supplementary [[#Alignment Day|alignment days]].
## Kalends
The **kalends** of a month occurs on the very first starrise of a month. From the Night to Kalends, there are five starfalls until the nones.

Traditionally, the kalends would always mark the beginning of a new lunar phase. Debtors traditionally also paid off debts on the kalends.
## Nones
The **Nones** of a month occurs on the fourth starrise since the kalends. It is named because, from the Night to Ides, there will be nine starfalls until the ides.

Traditionally, the nones would mark a business holiday or a date for magical needs.
## Ides
The **Ides** of the month is on the ninth starrise since the nones. In antiquity, this marked the general "middle" of a moon cycle, but since the moons are more thoroughly understood, this meaning is obsolete. It is now used primarily for ceremonial purposes.
# Alignment Day
Each month [[Pinwheel Tempo]] has three **Alignment Days**, when the number of starfalls remaining until the next principal date is equal to the number of starfalls since the Kalends.

These occur monthly on the **3rd** (Third to Nones), **7th** (Seventh to Ides), and **16th** (Sixteen to Kalends). The events of alignment days are often used by horoscopes and [[Divination|diviners]] to determine how fate will change for the beginning, middle, and end of a month.
