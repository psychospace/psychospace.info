Guardian and originator of the [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] [[Nortian imperial family|imperial line]], **Uforia** (Эйфория), the **Dreaming Dragon**, once known as **Yamasachi**, is a demigod-level being which is in truth a blue [[Dragon#Umbral|umbral dragon]] born to [[Sakuya and Ninigi]]. It was born conjoined with [[Arahabaki|Umisachi]], and unlike its brother, she was born quiet and tired, yet eternally and monstrously grew. 

She is widely worshipped by the [[Temple of the Uforiad]], and has an immensely powerful ability to [[Dream|dream]] wondrous, [[wish]]-granting dreams.

Stories say that Uforia is actually the mortal body of [[Mynos]], the Burning Rainbow.

# History
She was born eternally asleep and with immense psionic abilities. After Umisachi earned its name as the God's Error, Yamasachi was taken on [[Angel]]'s wing to the remnant which would come to be named [[Yofora]].

The shell of Uforia is said to have acted as the boundary between its life and the beyond, protecting those inside.

As a wyrmling, the dragon Uforia met thirteen souls in her youthful dreams, each who had witnessed a form of terrible change. These thirteen were beset by eternal nightmares as a result of a cataclysm, a dragon-god which ate their sun, and that this plight is why they called to her. Such a deafening cataclysm it was that they had all but given up any hope of living any life that did not serve the dragon.

Uforia came to a horrific realization: that the dragon these witnesses saw was a version of herself: [[Dizforia]].

This vision was a shadowed future where her dreams became hostile to the imagination, for they all called her name as the perpetrator and spoke a forbidden phrase when they did so. In learning this, Uforia rejected this opposing force with all her psionic might, channeling her disavowment of the forbidden phrase by removing a piece of her own [[Echo|shadow]] altogether.

Uforia eventually realized that she could not wake up from her dreams, but did not wish to, believing that this was simply her peace of mind. To protect herself and this peace of mind, she initially severed her voice, creating [[Ekaitz]] from it. When this did not suffice, she deeply meditated and created [[Valerian]] with her very mind.
