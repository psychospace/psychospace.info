In [[magic]], "**discrepant**" is a descriptor for effects and entities whose [[epitome]] is without linear cause-and-effect: in other words, subjects or victims of [[time travel]]. 

As a rule, so long as they challenge [[logic]], creations like this are corrected usually swiftly after their event, due to the enforced rules created by [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]]. 

In the case of [[Antique#False antiques|false antiques]], for example, a discrepancy is created when an object exists twice: once as it was originally, and once as the form in which it was sent back. These objects are made older "in-place", as such objects rarely have any abilities to witness events prior to their willpower as *tsukumogami*, and so such oddities often go overlooked.

The most well-known example is the [[Amakudari's phantom|phantom]] of [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto|Amakudari]] which appeared before its younger self. Because of the overlapping existences, the rogue instance of Amakudari's future self created a discrepancy, which was resolved when the message it conveyed merely caused itself to fulfill the events of its history.

As another example, when [[Serena Nortia]] and her siblings attempted to reach the closed-off [[Uforia]] with a powerful conjoined force of [[monism]], Serena was snagged and pulled out of alignment with the [[worldline]] to exist extremely briefly alongside her [[Zero Day]] self, granting her a mere glimpse of the events (including of the [[tailed stranger]]). This discrepancy was swiftly corrected from Serena's perspective, but she reappeared aboard the [[Wings of Dawn]] around 18 hours after her disappearance. ^182a4e
