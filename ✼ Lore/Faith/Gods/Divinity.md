A higher-being is known as a **divine**, or, more often, a "**god**" or "**goddess**". Such beings are widely considered [[immortal]] by any sensible reckoning, even though gods are known to occasionally die and be reborn. A being is only truly divine if it dwells in the [[Welkin]].

Divines are bound by the [[Zero-Draw]] Rule.

Though many divine and near-divine entities exist, the most commonly worshipped group of gods is [[Pantheon of Dawndust|the one]] normalized by [[Dawndust]], seen below.
