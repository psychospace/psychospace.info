In internal discourse, witches popularly refer to a personal [[Soul bond|link]] to their [[patron]] as a "**Gift**" of [[witchcraft]], sometimes also known as a "mystery". People with a Gift will find that occult studies of [[magic|magic]] are like a second-nature to them. ^ba83de

A Gift enables a witch to see past limitations in the [[Divine Equation]] and its [[logic|logic]]. No witch knows at first how their Gift of witchcraft will manifest, exactly, only that its inspiration should not be wasted. A Gift is created regardless if the witch understands what exactly this connection binds them to, such as the case with [[Omen|omens]] born Gifted.

Whether or not this force is taken at face value is open to consideration. Regardless if so, a Gift usually harbors with it the realization of possibilities. The [[Gift of Stars]] is one such powerful example.
