**Amanese** or **Elvish**, known natively as **Mänyya**[^1] is the modern [[Elf|elven]] language used in the Heavens, in particular [[Bullion]]. It is full of beautiful syllabary that turns to sharp, convincing language when dealing with topics that are distasteful or combative.

Derived from older languages which were highly complex and difficult for short-lived races to master, modern Elvish is a truncated version with some older elements grandfathered in.
