The peoples collectively known as **Kuroki Keiichi** (“first nobility of the black-tree”) are a nomadic sect found all throughout [[Bullion]]. They are ruled, loosely, by [[Kuroki]].

Originating from ancient stories of “the Allegiant”, a race of [[Outsider]] beings once encountered by [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] voidfarers, the Keiichi possess strong concepts of property and hospitality in hopes of protecting themselves, and in overseeing land and protecting nature on each side of reality. 

# Description
Sometimes offensively called by the [[Oa'Rovi|Primordial]] term “*Yn’deha*” (‘lost folk’, implicitly stupid), these peoples keep old worship alive through a spiritual oral tradition, and refuse notions of seized ownership, believing that nothing can be taken from them which comprises part of their individuality. This practically manifests as an adherence to a code of familial protection and nomadic settlement, as well as surgical warnings provided to others when it becomes required to steer clear or disturb nature.

Their master, Kuroki, speaks magically with their faction's council of hostmasters, who each oversee a particular stretch of the [[Bullion]] wilderness and the black-trees that make their home in the towns and countryside there, acting as a powerful magical patron. 

Despite mixed-trending-negative interactions with smaller communities, and mixed-trending-positive with many cities, the Kuroki Keiichi are not represented in [[The Shibboleth]], Bullion’s ruling council. Their concepts of hospitality have them hiding in plain sight in many developed communities all over the remnant, and all major cities have a black-tree presence to one degree or another.
