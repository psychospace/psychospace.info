Named for the first Master of Military, [[Sumiah Kopyc]], the **Kopyc District** is the lower-rung of society in [[Drastic]], existing farther inland along defunct canals and winding riverbeds now built into the structure of the city itself. While originally proposed to house militia, it now mostly acts as economy housing.
