The **Mutagen of Absolute Self** is a most complex psychoactive substance, which causes the user to experience intense sensory hallucinations that put one's self face to face with a manifested [[Logic|Fate]], for the purposes of liberating the inner self from the body: to bring the most true peace to one's [[soul]]. 

This [[Antique]] mutagen is said to restart one's life from scratch when it is imbibed, allowing them to make certain choices about how their life took place. It challenges the self-[[Soul bond|bond]] that keeps one's soul together.

It was first created by master alchemists to best prepare the user for [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] or [[death]], but it is almost never created these days, for Fate is unkind to those who do not require audience. It was created once by [[Chance Seria]], though it was flubbed, and they were reborn as [[Buttons and Snooze]].


# Description
It has a murky cloud-like consistency, but its color appears different to each creature who observes it, provided that creature has a soul of their own. If a creature doesn't have a soul, the liquid appears transparent to them.

It is said this mutagen is an extreme extrapolation of the divine stipulation that forms the [[spell]] *[[gentle repose]].* Not only does it manifest as peace in the face of uncertainty, but also new life as well: trading the uncertainty of death for the certainty of liberation.

The technical name of the mutagen, "Spiraling Dance to Eternity", is an ancient [[MÃ¤nyya]] phrase that was coined when that people tied themselves to [[Psychospace]] and enabled their genetic immortality and biological sexlessness through willful transmutation, and as such this mutagen attempts the same sort of effect.
