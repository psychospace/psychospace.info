**Vorgon'vor**, **Third Death**, is an indeterminate being who is believed to be the very first [[Avatar of Death]]. Their name is sometimes interpreted as **the Most-Careful** or **He Who Is Wise to All Ends**. 
 
It is from his name that the term [[vorpal]] is derived.

# Historical Attestation
In some of the earliest known [[First Magicians|First Magician]] poetry to deal with the concept of death and entropy, the following mythos is recounted.

At the same time the [[Anti|divine fusion]] happened, a being known as **First Death** emerged as its antipode.

During the [[Unknown Era]], from within the First Death's body spilled the energies controlled by all [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]], as runoff and anti-matter from the matter which shaped [[the Planet]] from [[Mana (plane)|Arcadia]].

This First Death later found itself become **Second Death**, in the course of [[Cientia|returning]] the concept of [[time]] and [[Vitality energy|vitality]] as opposites to [[void energy]]. With this, the First Magicians theorized that death and life were two opposite axes on something like a [[Worldline|worldline]]. This further tied in with [[Exponen]] being eternally stillborn, and overseeing death in that permanent nascent state.

The First Death represented bodily [[death]], while the Second Death represented the death of one's [[Echo|echoes]]. So this poetry claims, Vorgon'vor was an aspect of the Second Death: its "weapon", which it could use to [[Domain|influence the world]] more directly.

With some uncertainty, the modern interpretation of this text is that Exponen impacted the separation of the Second Death, into the "Third", Vorgon'vor, as a matter of ensuring [[reincarnation]] and a "future" remained permanently anchored to the Heavens: some things end, so all things else will continue, so all things will end. One minus one plus one equals one.
