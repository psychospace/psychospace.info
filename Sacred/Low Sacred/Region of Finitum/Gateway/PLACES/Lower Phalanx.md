The east entrance to [[Gateway]], from the [[Lilliputian Battlefield]], is a multi-level complex, comprised of tiered stone terraces, gardens, and houses that gradually climb upward. This area, with a panoramic view out over the Battlefield, is known as the **Lower Phalanx**, and is guarded by orange-armored Starscouts, marking them as recruits. This gate into the city is altogether closed when nightfall arrives.

Here, you can find less adventurer-centric businesses. Unlike [[Infantry Square]] up above, this place was developed last, mostly out of gentrified forts and built on old training grounds. As such it became Gateway's nightlife district, filled with cafes, chateaus, artist boutiques, retirement homes, jewelers, and tailors.
