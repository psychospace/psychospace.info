***Sparking smoke*** was the name given to a kind of [[magic]] ability which became the trademark of the [[Witch-King]]. It was evidently something granted to him by a patron force.

Its most common manifestation took the form of a kind of heavy mist, black and thick with tiny pinpricks of electricity, jolting and jumping out of it. Engulfed by it, people's insides rotted, their weapons rusted, and whoever died by it turned into a [[ghoul|ghoul]]. 

This was a power that the Witch-King apparently commanded at will. Deep into his criminal reign, people began to place bones and bone jewelry in windowsills or hanging over doors, as their clattering might keep the Witch-King away, and their breaking would be a good portent of his dreaded smoke.
