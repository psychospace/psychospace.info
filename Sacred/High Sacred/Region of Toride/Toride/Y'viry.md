**Y'viry** was an ancient [[Carapa Republic]]-era city that was one of the largest settlements of its time.

Sitting on the edge of the Fields of Twilight, it was necessary for it to act as a powerful home-base for the battles ongoing in the region later named the [[Kurjan Badlands]]. As such, the people there fostered a culture around a cult of defense, privilege, and protection. The mightiest of the castles was called the Castle of Castles, also known under the name of **T'ryyd**, or the Impenetrable Needles, for its many sturdy towers.
