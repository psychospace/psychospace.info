**Angels** are members of an [[immortal]] race mostly known as being the defenders of [[Welkin]], usually inscrutable by mortal reckoning, despite [[High Sacred]]'s literal and figurative proximity to their forces. They are primarily comprised of grandiose organic machines that defy traditional definitions of life, each distinct in its own grotesque and awesome way. 

They are the originators and guides of [[Aasimar]] and their predecessors the [[Evangel|evangels]].

It is a well-known superstition that only the monarch of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] can make positive contact with angels, utilizing their familial angelic guide [[Memoria di Alato]] as a liaison. However, the truth of this is doubted.
