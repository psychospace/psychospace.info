![[⎋ Secondary Canon]] ![[⎋ Real-World]]
***Psychospace: Second Contact*** is a series run by Ena "CombustibleToast" inside the *[Lancer](https://massifpress.com/lancer)* system, exploring the notion of combining [[the Heavens]] with a science-fiction setting. 

It began on January 8, 2024.

# Summary
It covers an [[✼ Story Hub#AUs|alternate universe]] in which the [[Antic Sea]] suddenly appeared in the Milky Way some fifteen-thousand years from (out-of-game) present day. The existence and nature of [[psychospace]], let alone [[Human|humans]] indistinct from expectation, runs afoul of their commonly understood science.

The appearance of the Sea, termed DSA-40975, was quickly investigated as an anomaly by *Lancer*'s Union, the governing body of much of the local Milky Way, befuddled by both [[magic]] and the medieval level of tech they saw on the ground. Per their standard procedure, once first contact was established upon their landing at [[Ladybug]], Union offered the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] under Queen [[Velocis Dino]] a tentative place in its affairs, while setting up an operating base nearby in the flagship *[[U-MC Atlantea]]*. However, the relationship quickly soured due to the eerie, almost [[Outsider|alien]] nature of these visitors, and this animosity does not bode well for the future. 
 
With the state of relations between Union and DSA-40975 quickly falling apart, a squadron of elite mech pilots known as Lancers, consisting of [[million-dollar]], [[MechaMondayz]], [[Warden (SC)|Warden]], [[Wretch (SC)|Wretch]], and [[Kitty-Regent]], are dispatched from the *[[Draccor]]* to the *Atlantea* to fuel her up and make for atmospheric escape, but quickly find more than they bargained for: a [[dragon]] tearing the *Draccor* apart on deployment.

Something is about to go terribly wrong.
