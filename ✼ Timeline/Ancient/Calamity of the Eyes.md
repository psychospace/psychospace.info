The **Calamity of the Eyes** is a shared mythological event which took place assumedly during [[The Gathering]]. Its exact length or even if it truly occurred is unknown, but the myth has analogues in the lores of the [[Kuo-toa|kuo-toa]], [[Kobold|kobolds]], [[Dwarf#Duergar|duergar]], [[Goloma|golomas]], and theoretically explains the geneological disappearance of distinct [[First Magicians|First Ones]].

# Event
It is said that during the Gathering, [[Bioh]] herself descended upon [[The Heavens]]. At the time, most of the [[Creature|creatures]] which existed on [[The Planet]] had many eyes, possibly a result of [[Aberration|aberrant]] influence. 

Along with Bioh, a host of [[Angel|angels]] and [[fiend|fiends]] swept across the lands of every [[Plane#Realm|realm]] in the stack, plucking eyes out of the skulls of each and every creature, until only two eyes remained in every head they could find. This number was apparently in accordance with the duality seen in many [[Divinity|divine]] forces. 

It is believed by some that this was apparently a desperate play to avoid any necessary treaty with the [[Outsider|Outsiders]]. 

## Aftermath
When this act was done, no creature alive remembered that their forms should hold many eyes, and the world continued to spin as though nothing had happened. This act, in effect, thieved and reduced the collective insight of the mortal realms by untold magnitudes.

It was only ever those who stayed sufficiently hidden that were able to recall the Calamity at all, though the sheer fear encoded into them by the event scarred them significantly. 
* Kobolds gained their trademark cowardice, fearing divine judgement befalling them again; 
* [[anadi]] avoided the total destruction of their native literature by melding the magic needed to maintain a humanoid shape into their essence;
* kuo-toa were reduced to their fishlike state, no longer resembling the [[Aboleth|Aboleth]] masters who had avoided the whole affair; 
* [[Illithid|illithids]] forgot the secrets necessary to escape the planet; 
* the [[Dwarf|duergar]] were seduced to remain underground forever by the lies of [[Imagi]]; 
* golomas now had immense paranoia at the thought that at any moment, the affair might be repeated, and a deeply burning mistrust of two-eyed creatures;
* and, likely, untold thousands of other creatures lacked much of the insight needed to continue along their formative paths, becoming completely different at the close of the affair.

It is partly believed that the sight of many eyes has become a genetic fear (manifesting as [arachnophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnophobia), [scopophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopophobia), and sometimes [ommetaphobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ommetaphobia)) in many creatures as a result of this very event, as they likely suffered the most severe transformations.
