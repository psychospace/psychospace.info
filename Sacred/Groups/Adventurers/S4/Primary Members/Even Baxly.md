**Even " Eve" Baxley** (*eve-enn*) was a [[Harengon]] and the last cultist of the [[Avatar of Death|Avatar of Death]] [[Macha]]. 

# History
Even was born in [[1209 PT]], in a quiet town near the [[Weepywood]]. 

## Early Life
Eve grew up under the care of the [[Soaring Fledgeling Orphanage]], from which they never would be adopted due to their uncommon appearance. Eve was reclusive in their younger years due to their uncertain circumstances, preferring to seclude themselves in the church catacombs of [[Reapvale]]'s universalist church, where they would quietly read. Here, among their books and [[Scroll|scrolls]], is where Eve would find a book of Macha, the book that would determine the rest of their life. A great attachment to the book's teachings of life and existence grew within Eve. They gave Eve a sense of meaning and a sense of security, the first they had felt in their life.

These teachings and their wisdom would develop in Eve as they grew up under the unsure but encouraging watch of the high priest of the universalistchurch. The priest would even tell them of someone they could meet to learn more about the history of Macha and the Death Cult at the Grand Library of the [[Constellar School]]. Eve, invigorated by this information and the support from the priest, would work as a courier to build up the funds for the journey once they were old enough to undertake it. 

## Time at the Constellar School
Eve would finally arrive at their destination in [[1233 PT]]: Professor [[Cha’ar Guaco]]. Eve would convince the professor to take them on as an assistant in exchange for the education they were determined to receive. 

Over the next five years, Eve would assist in Guaco’s academic studies, mostly field studies of abandoned tombs and town ruins of an age past, as well as his classes. Eve, uncharacteristically for the time, would become somewhat of a mascot for the classes, with perfect scores even being stamped with the symbol of a rabbit. 

But while an exciting and fun period for Eve, they knew that time does not stop, and after these five years Eve and the Professor would agree that there was no more enlightenment left for the little rabbit if they were to stay with the School. 
## Spirit Journey
From there Eve would follow the teachings of Macha and begin wandering from place to place in a Spirit Journey studying the lives and deaths of all things big and small, in order to understand the true value of life so that they may always be able to remind others to love it. 

Eve’s Spirit Journey would conclude following their time as an entourage of the [[S4]] in [[1251 PT]], as chronicling the lives or deaths of great heroes is considered one of the many ways a spirit journey may be completed.
