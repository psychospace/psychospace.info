Dakouta Dino was a niece of [[Janen Dino]], and twin of [[Edmont Dino]]. She ruled alongside Edmont as the Twindragons, surviving him to become a lone queen. Under her watch, [[Saurus Castle]] was constructed.

She never married. Upon her death of natural causes in [[1011 PT]], a descendant of Janen named [[Stegos Dino]] was rushed to the throne at age 14.
