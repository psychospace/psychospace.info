The eight **Classical Schools** of Magic are traditional studies and divisions of [[Magic#Cast|cast magic]], initially introduced to the world by [[Elf|elven]] literature as derived from [[First Magicians|First One]] texts. 

Though they scarcely claim to define all magic by their existences, the Classical Schools provide a decent basis to understanding most basic types of [[spell|spell]], and many arcane casters explore a particular study deeply before further specifying.

The schools form four pairs of studies: one naturally active or generative, one naturally passive or degenerative.
