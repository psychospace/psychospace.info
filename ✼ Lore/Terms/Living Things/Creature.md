A **creature** is any [organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism) which is capable of experiencing reality. A creature is either mortal (beholden to [[Death]]) or [[immortal]].

Inside [[The Heavens]], creatures interface casually and naturally with [[Psychospace|psychospace]] using conscious, cognitive processes. All naturally biological creatures born under these rules are initially comprised of three things: a [[Body|body]], a [[Soul|soul]][^1], and a [[Echo|shadow]]. A creature born under the gods' graces also receives a [[True name (concept)|true name]], though they might never learn it.

[^1]: And its [[Fylgja|fylgja]].  If it is immortal, it has a [[Domain|domain]] instead.
