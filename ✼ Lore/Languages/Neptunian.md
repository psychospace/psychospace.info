**Neptunian** is a language largely spoken in [[Pinwheel]], originally forming as a creole of [[Shindani|Shindani]] and [[Oa'Rovi|Aquan]], though it lacks much of any mutual intelligibility of either language.

It is known for [[Neptune]], an ancient [[Genie|marid]] which originally gathered Pinwheel into its now characteristic shape.
