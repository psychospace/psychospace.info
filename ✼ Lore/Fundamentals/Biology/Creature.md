A **creature** is any [organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism) which is capable of experiencing reality. A creature is either mortal (beholden to [[Death]]) or [[immortal]].

Within [[The Heavens]], creatures interface casually and naturally with [[Psychospace|psychospace]] using conscious, cognitive processes. All naturally biological creatures born under these rules are initially comprised of three things: a [[Body|body]], a [[Soul|soul]][^1], and a [[Echo|shadow]]. 

A creature born under the gods' graces also receives a [[True name (concept)|true name]], though they might never learn it.

# Special Definitions
## Whatsit
A **whatsit** classifies any [[Creature|creature]] with a living [[soul]] yet without a [[body]] to its name. For example, a [[ghost]] is a whatsit.

Both whosits and whatsits can effectively be created artificially using [[Vibe]], but this is not a cheap process, and isn't the natural process by which these sorts of things are made.

## Whosit
A **whosit** classifies any [[creature]] with an animated [[body]] that does not have a [[soul]] to its name. Oft created by [[Spell|spells]], these forms can be whole or in part. 

For example, an [[unseen servant]] is a whosit.

Both whosits and [[Creature#Whatsit|whatsits]] can be created in isolation using [[Vibe]], but this is not a cheap process, and isn't the natural process by which these sorts of things are made.

As an example, artificial whosits, in the form of [[duplicrow|duplicrows]], make up the corps of the harpy couriers used by the [[Tower of Electron]].

[^1]: And its [[Fylgja|fylgja]].  If it is immortal, it has a [[Domain|domain]] instead.
