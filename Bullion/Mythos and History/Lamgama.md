**Lamgama** is a messianic figure, said to be a [[Divinity|god]] who appeared in various incarnations, who appears in the mythology of [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qaulhain]]. 

Said to be responsible for ending the [[Golden Wars]], it assisted the separated tribes in settling differences, somehow managing to reunite them after thousands of years of separation, partly through instructing them in a particular school of thought which it said led to "purity of mind and sanctity of heart".

The school-of-thought eventually emerged under a recognized name as the [[Talum Lamgama]].
