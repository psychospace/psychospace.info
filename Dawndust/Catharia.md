**Catharia** is a minor [[remnant]] in the [[Shining Sea]], nearby [[Dawndust]]. Catharia is notable for its high rotational velocity on the yaw-axis, due to a frayed relationship with [[Psionics|psychic]] [[gravity]].

The remnant contains many specialized native species and intriguing properties as a result of its consistent rotation (similar to [[Pinwheel]]), but study of it remains difficult and elusive, necessitating geometric calculations for [[airship]] landing speed and angle to be precise within the second decimal place to achieve a successful landing approach.

It is about half the size of [[Low Sacred]], covered almost entirely in thick jungle.

Due to the dangers of approaching Catharia, it is best known for being the grave of many treasure-hunters. It is believed that the first modern airship *[[Propheteer]]* eventually found its demise by attempting to land on Catharia. The [[Catharia Incident]] was one such doomed voyage, in which failing to approximate all the necessary variables led [[Jakoby Cutler]] to their untimely demise.
