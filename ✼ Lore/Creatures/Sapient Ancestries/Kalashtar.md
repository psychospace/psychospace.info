![[âŽ‹ Needs Expansion]]

A **kalashtar** is a [[scion]]-like heritage of #sapient creatures who have been united mind-and-body with a [[quori]], gaining its personality, memories, and sensibilities through [[Succession (ability)|succession]], revering these greater entities as guardians and often as family.

Typically impressed upon from a young age with devout destinies and [[dream|dreambound]] fears, kalashtar are often [[Psion|psychic]] and take to magic and magical research impressively easily.

Through unity of mind and body, a powerful *[[Quori]]* can imbue a mortal bloodline with power, existing as a twinned personality alongside any newborn soul in order to gain power and to recur throughout history. This process produces ***kalashtar***, who are bonded strongly to a *quori* and revere them as guardians.
