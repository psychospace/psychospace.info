*Not to be confused with "personal eidolons" known as [[Origo]].*

**Eidolons** are [[Figment|figments]] which act as the guardian and psychospacial representative of a group of people, usually a large, well-connected community. Eidolons are said to be created by the very [[Divinity|gods]] as liaisons, and are generated as a result of a purification of a settlement.

Eidolons form exclusively naturally in communities where a unity manifests, in addition to the crossings of [[Psychospace|Psychospace]]. The formation of one is often marked by a sudden awakening at the center of town, or at some landmark thereabouts, called its "spawn location". 

# Appearance
Eidolons are [[Dragon|draconid]] in general form, albeit with fur instead of scales. Some have described them interchangeably as horse-like, or sometimes as "sheep dragons", resembling mythology regarding dream. They may take on a more humanoid shape at will, and can freely switch between them, with their "clothes" generally approximating their personalities.

All eidolons are made in the image of [[Athemat]], the grandfather deity of all psychospace, and more of his daughter, [[Exponen]]. By family tree, they are cousins to all other draconic entities: effectively the psychological versions of dragons.


# Personality
A community needn’t give the eidolon a home, but it will often find one if it isn’t given one. It attempts its best to live amongst people and help them out in anyway it can. An eidolon takes on personality traits predominantly displayed in their community: for example, a town of gamblers would have a greedier eidolon, or a more vicious and aggressive town might have an eidolon prone to provoking others.

In general, eidolons are prone to being scholarly beings. with immense power over the people they represent and an immense spiritual link to other eidolons. They do not cast definite [[Magic]] with spells as most creatures do through psychodefinition, but instead create things out of psychospace in accordance with their powers, technically termed “[[weaving]]”.

# Death
The circumstances of an eidolon's death An eidolon dies naturally when the community it represented is no more. This death is often peaceful, though bittersweet.

If an eidolon is killed instead, [[Logic|fate]] shifts ever so slightly, and a community will inevitably [[Off-wave|lose unity]]. The echo left behind will turn into harnessable energy, often condensed to the the form of [[Hepatizon]] or [[Orichalcum]] items depending on their disposition. A community can recover from the death of its eidolon, but it is often a 50-50 chance.

An eidolon can always spawn anew if its community recovers, taking a new, different form with a different name. However, it cannot reform naturally if it is killed with certain magic weapons, such as the [[Psychobullet]], or if it dies through [[Light (property)|lightlessness]]. In this case, an eidolon could potentially never return.
