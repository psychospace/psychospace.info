**Archipel** is a [[remnant]] that is proximally nearby [[Bullion]], in ancient times ruled by gallant [[Elf|elven]] cities which sought partly to conquer all seas, fostering a culture of conquering. 

Archipelian conquistadors reached the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]], laying claim to it thanks to the assistance of [[Ithuriel Rysae|Ithuriel I]].

Archipel is the homeland of many mountain dwarves. Eighteen [[eidolon|eidolons]], more than any other remnant, live there, acting as captains of the largest vessels that sail her oceans (known as "seatowns").

During the time of the [[War of the Masters]], Archipel was ostensibly an ally of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]], with bolyar [[Kamikatsu Fukushiza]]-dono, a feudal trade prince from Archipel who offered a large fleet of ships and skilled labor, helping to finance Sacred's elements of the war so long as Kami got some islands to control.

After the war, three of Archipel's largest cities, united under the Crest of Rinne, were annexed as part of the [[Emirate of Qaulhain]] after they bought their way into their highest-priced clientele.
