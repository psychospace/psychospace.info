**Dragons** are reptilian [[Creature|creatures]] with immense [[Magic]] deeply tied to [[Psychospace]], and thus, to the roots of the world and to people. Being represented by the Grandfather Drake [[Athemat]], dragons are considered rulers over [[The Above]].

# Abilities
Most true dragons possess some form of flight, and many are capable of magic, speech, personality, diplomacy, and [[reincarnation]]. They generally speak [[Draconic]].

To hatch a new dragon, the egg must be exposed to elements which are bound to it for twenty [[Month (unit)|moons]].

Dragons are peculiar in their sapience. It is likely that, in ancient times (such as prior to [[The Gathering]]), dragons walked the planet in place of mortals.

As a result of a failed scheme by the snake god [[Eoremu]], dragons are capable of passing down their blood in such a way that preserves the original's intent: in other words, a creation which is made by propagation of dragon's blood can be imbued with a purpose by that blood to the point that the creature effectively takes the shape the dragon placed upon it.

# Strata
There are many types of dragons. Broadly, the most two common strata are **metallic dragons** and **chromatic dragons**, who were first created in opposition to one another. In general, metallic and chromatic bloods never cross, and half-breeds or "misplaced" births are considered openly embarrassing.

## Chromatic
**Chromatic dragons** are dragons borne of pure mental willpower and energy, true children of the [[Chartless Sea]]. Their scales are rocky and generally marred in vibrant shades that strike the imagination, as core color associations are some of the most powerful deep-set survival instincts that pervade mortalkind, hence their name and fantastical reputation. 

Chromatics tend towards malevolent acts, both out of believing themselves more significant than other mortals, and also out of desperate, violent needs, such as for survival themselves. Young chromatics are little better than animals, and though they continue fashioning their agendas, they might still have childish streaks with destructive or disruptive consequences.

They are divinely represented by [[Mynos]].

Red, green, blue, white, and black dragons are the most common chromatic dragons.
## Metallic
**Metallic dragons** are dragons borne of pure mental potential and determination, true children of [[Kibangan]]. Their scales are usually sleek and highly reflective, resembling freshly refined ore, gorgeous ingots and alloys, or full bodies of armor, imagery that defines their role. 

Metallics tend towards acts that are more neutral or beneficial to others. They believe their height and role in the universe over mortals pushes them to act as allies and serve themselves only out of spurious curiosity, dedication to an order or ideal, sheer entertainment, or necessity. The more animalistic or young of the metallic dragons can be true nuisances due to a form of the Dunning-Kruger effect, where they believe their limited experience with mortalkind can be broadly applied. In many ecosystems, metallic dragons may act as apex predators. Most metallic dragons loathe to speak to one another, as their mindsets often clash, though for the right purpose they will forge deals.

They are divinely represented by [[Prus]].

Copper, gold, silver, brass, and bronze dragons are some of the most common metallic drakes identified.

## Astral
**Astral dragons**, sometimes called **gemstone dragons**, are a rare breed of dragon said to be born under the influence of the [[Dark Sea]]. Such influence oft drifts through the [[Cloudscape|clouds]] of the Above, and sometimes a dragon is possessed to understand and harness that power. Their births may be portended by events of great astrological importance, such as a shooting star or a rarely-witnessed comet. Astral dragons have prismatic scales and skin that refracts and alters light, and hovers faintly over the body.  

Due to their rarity, astral dragons are subject to a great deal of speculation. The best known is the amethyst dragon [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]], who captured a star when they were very young and went on to travel the universe with its Gift. Some [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] texts describe dragons constructed entirely of light that were encountered [[Out There]]. In modern interpretations of the [[Folly of the Twins]], [[Calcula]] and [[Bioh]] took the form of astral dragons.

## Umbral
**Umbral dragons** are legendary dragons born under mysterious, divine circumstances, identifiable by their scales being stained mostly black. An umbral dragon has their psionic capabilities and power magnified by a factor of possible thousands, able to create [[Rivenium]]. These births are never anticipated, and take a toll on the parent.

Only two, [[Uforia]] and [[Arahabaki]], are known to exist, borne of the [[Blackflame]].

# History
![[‚óç The World Born in Stone]]

## Zhill
The original stone-hearted dragons, also known as the Zhill, did not start with life or with perspective. They acted many beasts do, seeking territory over the broken pieces that Anti saw, for what the God of Gods saw was their creation's work to inherit. When the nature of [[Kibangan]], influenced by the Ignition Point's roots in the "truths" of ancient civilization and the "ideals" of its functional originals, took shape, the world began to form "rules", and thus the dragons, the creatures that had given their own lives meaning, suddenly found psychospace another realm to conquer.

This is how [[Psychospace]] came to be, and how dragons came to be alongside it.
