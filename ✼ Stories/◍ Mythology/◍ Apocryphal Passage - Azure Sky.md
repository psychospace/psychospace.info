>[!quote | speaker bg-blue] From the [[Xvaka|Xvakan]] [[Apocrypha of Winds]]
>[[Heartknock|Schools of madness]] listen,<br>
The prayers only for death:<br>
The path to heart's envision…<br>
[[High Sacred|Twin]] [[Breaking of Sacred|broken]] [[Low Sacred|lands]], upset.
>
Teachers of [[Miraclesfield Experiment|your tortures]],<br>
Twenty all for thought.<br>
Eighteen counts the sutures,<br>
[[Kingdle Fire|And]] [[Kingdle Coal|two]] to lead the flock.<br>
>
[[Ikabod Caruso|Three tired eyes]] to show you.<br>
Four [[Trobairitz|broken]] [[Certain (evangel)|eyes]] who flee.<br>
[[Linnaeus Dino|Five-pointed star]] [[Dragonic Curse|made anew]],<br>
And [[Visitant|six]] [[SUEANNIL|pairs]] nightmares see.<br>
>
Seven shall number [[S4|sealers]]:<br>
Bore witness of the [[Red Spark|knell]].<br>
Thirteen shall total [[Nortian Conspiracy|leaders]]:<br>
Those [[Project KC|spared]] of [[Elseworld|lasting hell]].<br>
>
In cloak and sword [[Serena Nortia|you]] flee there.<br>
In mind and body true.<br>
In will and acts, you prove [[Successor (Nortia)|heir]]<br>
To [[Scarla Nitrum|madness through and through]].<br>
>
[[Ghost storm|Azure sky]] brings [[Shohei Integra|a child]]<br>
Of [[dragon]]'s ill repute<br>
To [[Monism|dream and drive]] awhile:<br>
The face, the mask, [[Bias coagulation|dispute]].<br>
>
Seven souls, seals, one<br>
[[Dinofang|All linking all the rest]].<br>
[[Blackflame|Darkness scorch]] [[Linnaeus Dino|the son]]<br>
When all unite [[⎊ Golorr Bares All|the crest]].<br>
>
[[Sakuya and Ninigi|Blue and red]] in tandem,<br>
[[Uforia|The]] [[Arahabaki|bloods]] a fusion mix.<br>
[[Occultation|Deep and endless phantom]]<br>
In [[Locket|vessel number six]].<br>
>
The [[Sky-scrape|final seal]] unbroken,<br>
The [[Out There|stars]] will [[Starfall|rise and set]].<br>
The death of words awoken,<br>
The hope eternal yet.<br>
>
The [[Arizhmiya|secret]] now a memory,<br>
The [[New Magic|destiny]] the same.<br>
The [[Time|chain]] without [[Arizhmiya|its sentry]],<br><br>
[[Zero Day|All worlds and winds remain]].<br>
