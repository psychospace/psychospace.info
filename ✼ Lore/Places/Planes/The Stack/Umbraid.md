The **Umbraid** is the axiomatic [[Elemental energy|elemental]] **plane of wood**, a layer of [[The Planet]], placed in between the [[Dark Sea]] and [[the Above]]: air and water, its two components. Though it has apparently existed since [[The Gathering]], it only reemerged recently, following [[Zero Day]].

Its name is an antiquated [[Shindani]] turn of phrase which refers to both a "braid" (the tangle of branches which defines the realm) and "strife".
