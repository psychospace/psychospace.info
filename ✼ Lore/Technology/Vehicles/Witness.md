Pioneered by fringe thanatologists, **Witnesses** or **Sarcophs** are hulking metallic armors, revived forms of ancient [[Wild Magic]] machines which were the manned weapons characteristic of [[Ith'Paraan]]. These use [[rivenium|riven]] [[copper]] wires to coax [[Ghost|ghosts]] into controlling the frame.
 
A sacrificial copilot (who is turned into the ghost moving the armor) is necessary; all subsequent pilots must have “room in their minds” for the detached soul's voice. In ancient times, they were apparently used as assistive and reviving devices for those of extreme power, who would collect those of lower caste and suffuse the metal with their souls to power impeccable weapons. 

Due to the [[Os'Grun]] impact, Witness technology would need to be redeveloped, something only found in fringe cults, such as those empowered by [[new magic]].
