Selah is the second daughter of the Levin family. She is bold and hot-headed. She loves her family but playfully makes fun of them with her signature sarcastic wit. For example, she mocks Eldral for failing out of the swordfighting academy they both attended and where she now teaches.

At the academy, she teaches a combination of dueling and the history of the various forms of swordfighting. She is frustrated with her mother for harping on about how she should think about settling down. Calls [[Eldral Levin]] "Elly-bear" and "Mighty Hero", which he hates. Loves animals.

Selah is 28.



Sister to Eldral Levin.
