**Pendulum** is the primary shipbuilding and commerce town in [[Low Sacred]]. Whereas those in Shero's Reach may come to see the landscapes and be inspired by its underground majesty, The city of Pendulum is a feather in the [[Kingdom of Sacred|Kingdom]]’s cap, a military city on the extent of Sacred’s southern point.

At the far western shore, flanked by sandy-bricked watchtowers, the extensive branching wooden platforms and planks of an elaborately constructed docking system for dozens of airships of varying size and shape juts out from the remnant like the roots of some massive tree. The Ancient, as this dock is commonly known, forms the truest backbone of Sacred’s ship-building industry, and here, surrounded by an untold history of worldly and personal interests, these magical marvels are initially crafted.

Similar to Shero's Reach, it was built near and its culture was informed and inspired by [[Unitor]] ruins, but also the ancient citystate of [[Sylva]], with various other cities in and around the main one lining the mountain. The town seems an uncomfortable mixing between its two origins, with the balance between manmade and natural architecture having a dichotomy that bleeds into the people's actions.

No better is this illustrated than by the ziggurat base [[Atlan]] where Duchess of Kyuna, [[Kanisu Hanazaki]], does her work as the nation's master of magic.

In the [[Anchor Mountains]] to the south of Pendulum lies a fey village of satyrs named [[Barbiche]] upon a mountain titled **Snowcrown Mountain** (Sekkan).
