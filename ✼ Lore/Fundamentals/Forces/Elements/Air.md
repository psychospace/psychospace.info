Much like the real-world, **air** describes the [oxygenated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen) composition of the atmosphere, providing health and enabling respiration for most [[creature|living things]]. Within [[the Heavens]], air is an [[elemental energy]], associated with wind, motivity, destiny, skills, and the very [[skysea|skyseas]] which make up their experience.

Magically, air is a force of defined [[chaos]], forming one of the four fundamental axioms of nature, alongside [[fire]], [[water]], and [[earth]]. The [[Plane#Realm|realm]] of air for [[the Planet]], where its most potent power lies, is known to be [[the Above]].

Air is the physical-world equivalent of [[Vibe]], and shares many properties with its psychospacial twin, especially in terms of quality. Its fusion with [[water]] forms the basis of [[wood]].
