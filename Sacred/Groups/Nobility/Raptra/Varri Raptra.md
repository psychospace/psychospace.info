# History
Born in the winter of [[1229 PT]], Varri was a lowborn member, connected distantly to the high noble house of Raptra. Though others like them ended up in lower political positions, Varri sought to be taught in the same hybrid [[Swordschool|swordschool]], fusing elements of of [[House Dino#Revenger|revenger]] and Raptra's own, that the reigning queen used. During private tutoring in this style by [[Cefal]], Varri and the young prince met, and became fast friends: and in the process, Varri became a squire of the Victory Starscouts in an attempt to foster their friendship further.

During the [[Dragonic War]], as with all of Linnie's cohorts, Varri was incensed to heroic action. In the midst of regular [[Alchemy|alchemical]] treatment for gender-confirmation, Varri bravely led the [[Gateway]] forces of the [[Sacred Dragoon Force]] in their efforts to mobilize and take out [[Dom Otdykha]] in its moment of weakness, once the [[MMT - Arc 2, Ephemeris|mission to rescue Chiave Neeman and Volk Vendleberg]] had been safely executed.

Following the war, Varri continued to serve as one of the first members of the [[Order of Hope]], and one of the highest-profile starscouts, leading to their being chosen as the starscouts' leader.
