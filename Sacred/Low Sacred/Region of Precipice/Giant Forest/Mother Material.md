Hag, the master of [[Rosewire Abatah]], who lives in a cottage deep within the [[Giant Forest]]. She has a coven of [[kenku]], "The Flock of None", at her service, who defend her and act as her eyes.

Rosewire acts as the ringleader of Mother Material's outward forces.

She was born and raised a hag by her predecessor [[Mother Miraculous]] in [[the Beastlands]], but was then sent out unto the world as a cruel game, much the same as many hag children are: to be raised amongst mortals until they came of age. When Miraculous passed, all her subjects fell unto Material, and as did her magical moving house, called the [[Traveling Nest]].

Meanwhile, Miraculous' house found itself uninhabited for many a year, believed to be cursed. In this time, Mother Material placed one final token in the house memory of her mother before departing. Eventually words of these curses passed, and the house became property of the Neeman clan. The token is yet being used by [[Chiave Neeman]].

She wields the Woodsman's Axe.
