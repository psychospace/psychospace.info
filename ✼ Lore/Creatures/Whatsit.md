A **whatsit** classifies any [[Creature|Creature]] with a living [[Soul]] yet without a [[Body]] to its name. For example, a [[Ghost]] is a whatsit.

Both [[Whosit|whosits]] and whatsits can effectively be created artificially using [[Vibe]], but this is not a cheap process, and isn't the natural process by which these sorts of things are made.
