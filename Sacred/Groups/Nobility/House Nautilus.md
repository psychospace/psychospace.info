**House Nautilus** is a noble house from [[The Well]]. Impressively connected to a coalition of mercenary companies, the house was a member of the [[Gold Clock Society]]. 

In [[1235 PT]], one of their number, [[Jarith Nautilus]], attempted to use magic he'd obtained abroad to force [[Kailey Synchronia]] to marry him, an effort which had [[Arthur Graywell]] hound his every move. Jarith used the Gold Clock Society to [[Synchronia-Nautilus affair|take revenge]] on Arthur's tarnishing of the house's reputation, something that forced Arthur into exile.

Their [[house words|house words]] are, "Illuminate the darkest night".
