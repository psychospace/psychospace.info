**Halflings** are a #sapient ancestry of short humanoids characterized by unerring optimism and powerful curiosity. They each can live about a century and a half.

Resembling small [[human|humans]], halflings have a [[logic#Guidance of logic|lucky]] streak and fascination with the communities around them, making pushes to integrate into society wherever they find themselves. It's a widely held folktale that this lack of centralization or the idiosyncratic nature of culture for halflings may be because their previous home [[remnant]] was destroyed or rendered inhospitable to them.

The wanderlust of a halfling leads them hither and thither, though they remain homebodies at heart. Though halflings were always seen as characteristically brave, the [[Age of Adventurers]] has led to their surge in notoriety, as this bravery and curiosity has been greatly rewarded.

Many halflings, especially of [[Bullion]], have kinship with [[harengon]], said to be their [[kinfolk]] equivalency.
