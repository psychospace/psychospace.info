![[⎋ Needs Rewrite]]
A satyr woman, mother of [[Kessah]] and of the bloodline of the Champion. She lives in [[Barbiche]]. The mother of Kessah, and granddaughter of the once champion of [[Sekkan-shin]], [[Gunser]], supposedly the 50th Champion. Wife to [[Reonin]]. Knows the importance of her daughters journey well but elects to more have no opinion on it than worry herself silly about Kessah’s safety, knowing that if she does good and stays alive, her hope will continue on.

Celene, a direct descendant of the Savior, was expected to give birth a month after the death of the current Dragon's Champion. Everyone in the village knew the next of kin to inherit the Silver Dragon's gift would be the unborn child Celene carried. Kessah's birth was therefore a huge celebration. She would be the first female in the bloodline to inherit the gift and was expected to grow up to be the strongest yet, as she was born with significantly more pronounced draconic features than any of her predecessors.
