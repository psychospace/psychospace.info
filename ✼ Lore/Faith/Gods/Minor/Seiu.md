**Seiu**^[晴雨], ***the Living Will***^[生きる願い, sometimes "the Living Wish" 生ける願い, probably due to regional differences in dialect.], is the creator being and deity of [[Kitsune]] who is patron to agriculture and crafting. 

# Description
Seiu is a being of indeterminate gender (and flexible pronouns, though it's usually a she)  While not all kitsune worship Seiu under that name specifically, most recognize the influence she has had over them, specifically in granting aspects of itself, such as dancing between forms. 

She is called "the Living Will" because she embodies the will to live, the will to keep going and live life to the fullest. 

Seiu respects many peoples that fly under the radar for most, most often those who are fueled by doing something they must rather than something they necessarily want to: for example, those beset by disaster, or those working to support a family.

# Mythos
When the First Ones, specifically of the remnant known today as [[Pinwheel]], sought the [[fey]] that they believed had afflicted them with [[Uzia calora|uzia calora]], Seiu, a mortal, revealed herself. 

Seiu preached that the [[chaos|chaos]] they all feared was responsible was not to be feared at all. Seiu taught them that all things, no matter how malign, are part of [[The Heavens|the Heavens]]: you cannot take the good without the bad, you must accept it as all parts of one whole. 

Seiu is credited with, at around this time, revealing the true nature of [[Psychospace|psychospace]] to the First Ones, and thus unlocking the secrets of [[magic]].

The coalescence started in the plague was furthered in nine of the young being's apostles, gifting them with Seiu's own abilities to dance between forms, creating the first kitsune. Seiu themselves assumed a divine mantle through a [[Mortal God Ritual]] which had been aided by these apostles.

# Cultural associations
Seiu is believed to operate through agents known as *senko*, literally "[[Wizardry|wizard]] foxes". These are foxes that seem to have more intelligence than usual, or kitsune who are deep into their priesthood and believe they can speak as a part of and for the whole of Nature. There are also folk tales of a specific *senko* by the name of *Lavas* (ラバス) who protects kitsune and others who have supposedly "lost their way".

Many kitsune (of the [[League of Joriele]], specifically) sometimes say they are "*seeing Seiu in their shadow*", so much that it has become a turn of phrase. This phrase, when used by a kitsune, is a point of pride, that they are walking the path that makes them most happy and fulfilled. When used by those who aren't kitsune, it is akin to being called "fox-possessed", a dispassionate thing that says the gods may be haunting your steps due to a personal depression or impending depression that will need to be resolved.
