A **whill** is a term for any powerful [[Elemental creatures|elemental]] which possesses a form of sapience. Most can trace their origins to [[The Gathering]].

The first whills, the [[jann]], possessed near-unlimited power, until the incursion of the [[Divinity|gods]]. This spurred a massive animosity towards the gods, which persists culturally in descendants.

The whills possessed energies which could reach through the [[Divine Equation]] and raise themselves to [[Mortal God Ritual|godhood]], which they used to ascend a number of themselves.
