The **scribe moth** is a large bug, an [[earth]] [[Elemental creatures|elemental]], with high intelligence. It holds an incredibly powerful trained [[Senzai|sight]] into [[Psychospace]]. 

The moths generally seek spaces with great power, especially that which gifts the knowledge of [[divination]]. Its limbs are marked with a sort of black goop that it uses to write down its divinations. Scribe moths are known to pupate and turn into [[Scribe adder|adders]] later in their long lives.

Their work is still done beyond their passing, as dead scribe moths still exist in the form of phantoms, a form crafted from their foresight necessary to "survive" [[death]]. These creatures read the plot of the future and inscribe each potential with runes, ruminating on the way that [[Logic]] shall appear to progress. 

Scribe moths are some of the most ancient creatures, especially among elementals, known to still exist in the world.
