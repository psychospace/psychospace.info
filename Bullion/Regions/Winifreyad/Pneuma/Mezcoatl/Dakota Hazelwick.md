**Dakota Hazelwick** is a 109-year old [[Elf|elven]]-[[Beastkin|therian]] [[Witchcraft|witch]], widely mythologized as *the Graven Witch of [[Mezcoatl]]*. They are also known as the Oracle of Sunfall. A prolific ally of the [[Bullion]] sect of the modern [[Coven of the Night]], Dakota is the author of much of the modern caster-side discourse on witchcraft's place in society.

Dakota is believed to be partly a multiversal traveler, using witchcraft to channel themselves to other worlds. Their windmill tower laboratory has sometimes been reported floating or missing for several days before returning. It is widely believed that Dakota's companion for such travels is a kenku by the name of [[Vim]], and/or sometimes an [[Angel]].
