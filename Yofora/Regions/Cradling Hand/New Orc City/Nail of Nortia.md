The **Nail of Nortia** is a clocktower and surrounding complex which stand tall in [[New Orc City]]. Of an ancient design, the Clocktower has marked time for the [[Great Nortian Empire|Empire]] for hundreds of years, its gaze constantly upon the world.

Long ago, a maester from [[Pinwheel]] crafted this clocktower using remnants of comets and meteorites which were gathered in Nortia, as well as pieces of dragonscale from a fallen castle from [[The Above]]. Since then, it has become a psychospacial conduit for many technologies, using it as a center point around which things can orbit, and in fact has evolved to become a keep in its own right.

This place is also known in [[Draconic]] and in official papers as as *Kyakuya no Kugi*, "Nail of Polar Night". It was named for Nortia's inability to see the sun, and thus a marked difficulty in keeping time.

The tower was built to face [[Orkrengrad]].
