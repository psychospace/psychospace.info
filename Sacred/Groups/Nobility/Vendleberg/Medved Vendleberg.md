The current patriarch of [[House Vendleberg]], Medved is a bear of a man. He is [[Volk Vendleberg|Volk]]'s father and is getting late in his life.

Medved is friends with [[Sagacita Aes III]] and both of them are not happy with [[Junah Rollingstone]] and his estate and wives, who all seem to be buying up and developing much of the city to become lord-mayor by proxy (the gent who owns the library is the actual lord-mayor per an old accord).
