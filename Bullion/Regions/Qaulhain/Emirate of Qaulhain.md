The **Golden Emirate of Qaulhain**^[(*cowl-hen*)] ([[Oa'Rovi]]: "City of Gold") is a large state to the southwest of [[Bullion]], a founding member of the [[The Shibboleth|Shibboleth]] and the first to reclaim the remnant following her [[Bullion#Miserable Age|Miserable Age]]. A nation rich with biological and material resources, it is overseen by the [[Golden Council]], and especially the Golden Emir, currently [[Es'kys Uliiz]]. 

Its capital city is [[Lainesia]], and most of its populace follows some variant of [[Talum Lamgama]].

The demonym of Qaulhain is *Qauli* (*cowl-ee*) or *Emirati* (*eh-mee-rah-ti*).

# History
## Temar
Predecessors to the Emirate date back to the early [[Bullion#Third Era|third era]] of Bullion. Until that time, much of the regions of modern-day Qaulhain were occupied by [[Elemental creatures|elementals]] of various ilk, in particular [[Scribe adder|adders]] who regularly terraformed the region and scared away most outsiders. Just before [[the Gathering]] began, the [[Adder King]] caused a violent schism in the remnant, today known as [[Apostate's Plunge]]; this was said to have been his attempt (possibly successful) in raising itself to [[Mortal God Ritual|godhood]].

Unlike many of the region's older ancestry, such as [[Holrfold]], the first settlers of Qaulhain, known as the **Temarites**, recorded their history relatively well, so it is still known that an ancestral capital resided in what is today known as [[Ingot City]]. Based on archaeological evidence, these predecessors are believed to have been begun as travelers from the [[Siella Valley]], eventually forgetting their own origin. As is told by their faith, their gods sent them on tests of faith into the darkened lands, and that these tests would often [[tribute|cost]] them their memories, rendering them unable to return.

Upon the banks of the Plunge, the society which emerged around it slowly grew, taming the wilds enough to begin farming, spreading a written and spoken language known as [[Temarine]] as an attempt to build up a stock of wisdom. They inherited powers from [[jann]] ancestry, who had acquiesced to the gods' demands and made better of it. 

## The Impact and the Schism

However, upon the [[Os'Grun]] impact event, much of the oldest infrastructure and civilization around the Plunge, known as the "true" city of gold, tumbled into the gap, said to still be intact (said to be unbreakable) but unreachable and unrecognizable within [[Tarnation]].

The society appeared split into two as a result of a disagreement as to what the Os'Grun impact ultimately meant. Some believed that it too was a divine test of faith, others believed it was a misused weapon of the fools in [[Ith'Paraan]], some attempt at covering their tracks whilst they [[Ith'Alnna|abandoned the planet]] and the gods. However, a major divide emerged in whether or not their own gods harbored mercy at all, or were instead capricious and violent, lashing out with first the Gathering and second the incidental destruction of their holiest of sites.

Thus, several tribes emerged and separated away from the tarnished city of gold, each with their own beliefs. The four emirates named themselves Laina, Alpoa, Somar and Derya, and each defined their own territory, though all four would name themselves as Temarites to outsiders.

## Union of Lamgama

Midway through the [[Bullion#Fourth Era|fourth era]], these tribes came into conflict with one another, egged on by externalities and other interests such as reclaiming lost valor and what treasures might be found in the "true" city of gold. These conflicts, known as the [[Golden Wars]], found themselves all brought to heel by a being said to be a [[Divinity|god]] known as [[Lamgama]].

With Lamgama's intercession, the "Golden Emirate", under the name of **Qaulhain**, emerged proper, along with a great ovaloid relic known as the [[Safhar Stone]], excavated from the city of gold's core. Lamgama's teachings and the pantheon his efforts assembled were now known collectively as [[Talum Lamgama]], and were followed by many. For many hundreds of years the great emirate served in Lamgama's name and forged a new future for themselves.

With the rise of the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]] in the east, eventually the united Qaulhain would come into a brief border clash, a conflict known as the [[Bullion Civil War]].
