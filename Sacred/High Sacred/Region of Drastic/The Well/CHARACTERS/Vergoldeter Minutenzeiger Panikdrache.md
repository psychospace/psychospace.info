**Vergoldeter Minutenzeiger Panikdrache** (*Gilded Minute-Hand Panic Dragon*), best known by "*Minty*", is the president of the [[Gold Clock Society]] and owns the *Big Score,* a massive casino-inn. He has a thing for funny people. 


![[⎋ Needs Rewrite]]


He is obsessed with gold, and though he pretends at being a gold dragon, he is actually a copper [[Dragon]] in disguise. [[Vyctry]] keeps him under watch. Known to be an eccentric businessman with a taste — nay, an obsession — with steak, and will eat the meat of any creature at least once: especially the meat of his enemies.

He takes the humanoid form of a golden [[Kobold]] man with broad shoulders and a distinctive powdered wig, as well as golden scales with a pastel-greenish rust: hence the name "Minty". 

He harbors a rabid yet organized demeanor. However, he is rarely seen in public, often only seen by the elite of the city. However, his visage and lair underneath the city produces illusions and oddities throughout the town.

He was born Tomanoya, metallic bastard of dragons [[Sakuya and Ninigi]].
