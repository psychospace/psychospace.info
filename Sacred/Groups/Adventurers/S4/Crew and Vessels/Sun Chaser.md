The ***Sun Chaser*** was an old bluesteel *[[Maneater-class]]* [[airship]] which was captained by [[Chadley Korol]] and his father before him. 

The *Chaser* was twisted over its 30 years of overuse and barely resembled a normal Nortian ship by [[1251 PT]]. It was horribly inefficient on its (third replacement) [[Quasidragon]] [[Core engine|core]], and decrepit by current standards, but, in theory, it could get someone through the [[Dustwall]] safely. A return trip? Well, that's a lot more questionable, now isn't it?

At the time of the [[Dragonic War]], it was docked in [[Port Fester]], impounded due to a then-current block on air travel due to the [[Ghost storm|purple storm]]. its crew then traveled overland to [[Drastic]]. 

After Chadley briefly allied himself with the [[S4]], the *Chaser* was eventually retrieved and fused with the *[[Red Diamond]]* by [[Maccus Integra|Maccus]] and [[Kazumi Integra|Kazumi Integra]] working alongside [[Nery Ravenna]], eventually culminating in the rechristened [[Kaiju-class]] prototype *[[Wings of Dawn]]*.
