This island just off the water coast of [[Drastic]] holds a [[Phantasm]] guarded by a huge square castle of old style. It is named "**Stygian**" for its relation to the phantasm, which was further built up to become a prison for the truly damned, between both [[Mount Celestia]] and the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. In the public eye, very little is known about the operators of the prison, all angels. The human keepers of the fort on Sacred's side are known as **the Shacklestars**, employed and chosen by [[Boldin Iron-Heart]] and Master [[Ijouti Cilin]].

The fort on the island (it's only real feature) is known as the Void of Stygian.

The Void is a prison for only the most dangerous of criminals, those with supernatural abilities. The prison itself does allow shipping and transport lanes to pass close by. Although it's hard to see inside, the occasional distant scream can be heard by boats passing near it, and flashes of what appear to be hellfire periodically gout out from the center of the pit. The [[Vault of Foreknowledge]] was contained within before it was opened by the [[S4]].
