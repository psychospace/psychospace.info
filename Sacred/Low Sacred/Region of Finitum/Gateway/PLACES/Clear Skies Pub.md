A frequented favorite of the local [[Victory Starscouts|Starscouts]], the tavern known as the **Clear Skies Pub** is a fancy place, frequented by the upper class of [[Gateway]].

**Sorade Usui Taiki**, also known as **Thinair**, is an air [[genasi]] detective and the pub's owner, since graduated to [[Victory Starscouts|Starscout]] Lieutenant. You've got the coin, Thinair knows a thing or two. Also known as "Thinair", Sorade has a knack for pulling off stealth missions without a hitch, but at the moment runs his passion project as an info trader and damn good caf√© manager at the Clear Skies Pub. 

Years ago, the [[Linnaeus Dino|Prince]] stayed here with his family, and Thinair traded secrets with them. As such Thinair trusts [[House Dino]] as much as he trusts anybody in his own family.

Clear Skies is named half for its owner and half for its decor, which is ambitious by this century's standards. Magical wood reflects the time of day in the outside world, turning to deep blue with pinpricks of light at night and bright blue with flecks of flowing gray and white during the daytime. No matter what, the [[weather]] in the tavern is always calm, unless Thinair gets mad, in which case storm clouds will pass in the distance of its mural. Its motto on the door is "No matter what the weather is, come inside and drink to your health, with calm winds and sun on high.""
