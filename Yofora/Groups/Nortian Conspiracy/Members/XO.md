A [[Changeling#Medial changeling|medial]] spy-for-hire identifying itself by the ancient rune **â¦»** (also written **XO**, pronounced ex-oh) is working for [[Nortian Conspiracy|the Conspiracy]].

Before the [[Dragonic War]], XO was known as a wild honorless shinobi, defeating any opponent they were set against. Eventually, they were caught trying to assassinate Contessa [[Scarla Nitrum]], wife of [[Illarion Parasom]]. In retaliation, Scarla held XO captive and tortured them for several months, mentally scarring the young changeling. 

Once Illarion returned to discover this, XO was offered a choice: be broken and inducted into the [[Prime Doppelguard]], or work with the Lord on a certain "project".

Posing under the stolen identity of Gris, head spy of the Third Flag Doppelguard, XO now works as a rogue agent, leading bits and pieces of the Doppelguard into Sacred's most sensitive corners.

Like all of the Conspirators, XO normally wears the [[Cloak of Excelsio]]. They currently wield the ghostly pink blade, [[Novalor]].
