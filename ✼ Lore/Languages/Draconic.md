![[⎋ Needs Expansion]]
 **Dora ihitō** ("dragon's speech"), known in [[Shindani]] as **Draconic** or **Athem**, is the native tongue spoken by [[Dragon|dragons]]. Its syllabery and structure partly resembles real-world Japanese, but has both subtle and major departures. It is a derivative of [[Arckan]], and it was originally given orthography by [[Dwarf|dwarvish]] transcribers.

Dragons are born naturally able to understand Draconic, though they do need to grow older before they develop the ability to speak it.
