Drayla Nailo is a dark elf, the nonbinary sibling of [[Precari Nailo]], who was slain in the employ of [[Bain Rollingstone]]. Junah executed a plan to save Drayla from his father and pursue justice rather than profit, leaving Drayla a home in [[Waxtown]]'s upper end district.

She is currently in an open relationship with Junah Rollingstone and [[Aegis Lockstock]].
