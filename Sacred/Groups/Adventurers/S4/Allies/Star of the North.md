![[âŽ‹ Needs Rewrite]]
**Star of the North**, or simply "Star", is a [[Catfolk|tabaxi]] paladin of [[Exponen]]. She hails from the tabaxi clan of [[Cule Cliffside]] in [[Archipel]].

![[icon_star.png|300]]

During her trip with [[Lazuli Dino|the prince]], she became a trusted confidant and a good friend of his, as proven by her ability to brandish and wield [[Dinofang]] after he was stolen away by [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]]. She is currently apprenticing with [[Ridd of Chained-Earth|Ridd]] in hopes of unlocking the connection she holds to the Prince through his blade.

Star is 20.
