The **RDM-8**, known affectionately as the **Eight-Count**, is a semi-automatic revolver produced by [[Ardium Dynamic Machines]] in [[Sirrhad]]. Chambered for *.80 Tarna* magnum ammunition, it was the third eight-chamber [[Firearm|firearm]] to break into the mainstream, the first to see mass-production, and the first to see regular use as a sidearm. 

It is now a staple of [[wildwalker]] iconography, though it has been succeeded by later innovations: for many years it represented [[The Shibboleth|Bullion]]'s strongest step in the "pistol wars" against [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] and [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacredite]] machinists.

The Eight-Count's ideation phase lasted unusually long, but was first produced in [[1272 PT]].  An RDM-8 was brought to the past by the [[Tailed Stranger]], presumably around the year [[1275 PT]].
