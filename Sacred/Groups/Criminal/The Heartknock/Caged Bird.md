The ***Caged Bird*** was the "[[Airship]]" used by [[Heartknock]]. It was, in essence, a small, floating laboratory inside a bionically-adjusted and magically-distorted [[kraken]].

It was partly destroyed following the [[Miraclesfield Experiment]], when [[Raxia]] tore it apart. However, it apparently vanished without a trace from [[Victory Canyon]].
