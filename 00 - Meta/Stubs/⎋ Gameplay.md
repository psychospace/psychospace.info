>[!question|ttl-c subt]- _"Congratulations, umbrellas exist."_ Gameplay may not be accurate to lore
>While many elements of the Heavens are designed around game systems, such as Pathfinder or D&D, the information on this wiki is [[âœ¼ Wiki Principles|intended]] to not prefer any one specific system. The existence of something in one system does not necessarily imply that it exists in the Heavens. For this reason, gameplay descriptions *may* not be accurate to actual intent or lore.
