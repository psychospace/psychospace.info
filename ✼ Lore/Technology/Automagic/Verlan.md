**Verlan**^[[[Shindani|Common]]: *vurr-LEN*, from original [[Sylvan]]: *where-LAHN*] is a form of automagic energy bound to crystals (also called **dust**), sourced from [[the Fortress]]. 

It is sometimes also simply called **Ley** or **Leytech**, due to the effects of the energy, as well as the tendency for [[Dust tunnel|dust tunnels]] to be built following natural leylines.

The technology behind verlan is largely considered the next step in the automagic revolution which began with [[lux]], and originates from [[the Fortress]], and most commonly deposits of [[noemite]] which have emerged from [[Väräh]]. 

# Properties
When sent through a semiotic or resonant conduit, known as a [[dust tunnel]], verlan creates a [[psinomenon]] that allows the transfer or propagation of [[Echo|psychic data]] and [[Psychic code|code]] across vast distances. 

Verlan's modern use has led to a generation of inventors using and advancing the technology, specifically radios, radio-computing, and telephony, as part of the ongoing trends of artifice and overall zeitgeist of “[[New Magic|new magic]]”. This has mostly been used for communication across [[Bullion]], especially in academia and government.

Verlanic instruments can pick up the influence of the [[The Signal|Signal]], making their practical adoption important as a countermeasure against [[new magic]].

# Production
Just like lux is centric on [[Light (property)|Light]], verlanic energy is a fundamental energy which can be commonly observed in [[psychospace]], but not interacted with directly.

Verlanic energy is generated naturally in small amounts by electromagnetic radiation and other processes, such as exposure to [[the Sheer]].

## Cruft
Despite being invisible to the naked eye and intermittently intangible when propagated through a dust tunnel, verlanic dust which remains physically stable and stagnant, like [[Lux#nox|nox]] before it, can contaminate reality left unchecked, emitting its own form of [[Haze]].

Such dust will eventually degenerate into a pink, purple, and red physical [[Mana|mana]]-like particulate, also called **cruft**, which is very cold to the touch. 

The issues of [[#cruft]]-generation are why it is important for a tunnel network to be calibrated correctly. Accumulating cruft can corrupt or alter the whole psinomenon based on its purity, so controlling their pollution levels is in the network's best interest. ^8d9058

Cruft can be eliminated through [[Reality-Bending|reality-bending]] it away, though this redirection itself can have implications across the entire network.

# History
 Though _verlan_ as an element has been known about for years, it was the [[Nortian Conspiracy]] who put it into use during the [[Dragonic War]]. Following the breaking of the occupation, Empress [[Serena Nortia|Serena]] shared the infant technology with other remnants. 
 
The discovery of noemite's compatibility with the technology massively sped up the ability to transmit things via verlan.
