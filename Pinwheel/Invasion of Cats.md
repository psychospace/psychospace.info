The **Invasion of [[cat|Cats]]**^[[[Draconic]]: *neko no shin'nyū*] refers to a series of odd events that occurred over the course of a single month in the city of [[Blure]] in [[Pinwheel]]. 

Each of these events appeared to be unrelated from one another, save for the fact that they were all shortly preceded by an inexplicable surge of stray cats appearing around the location. 

Because of this, locals and officials would come to dub this period of time its most commonly known name. However, in certain corners of the city, some instead call it 'The Judgement of Cats'. This is due to the fact that several people with very promising careers were not only the main victims of the random events, they were also swiftly discovered to have been engaging in some extremely questionable (if not outright illegal) actions. 

# Events
A few examples (and subsequent aftermaths) of events that are seen as related to the Invasion of Cats include:

* The very public freakout of a respected member of the community, in which they began to try attacking the cats and screaming how they were all 'secretly [[displacer|displacers]]' and 'they're all trying to get me'. After being dragged to the closest hospital and getting examined by a psychiatrist, it was revealed that they had actually been involved with a cult whose practices involved live sacrifices of cats. They were later taken in for questioning.
* An incident in which many people swore that they saw the spirits of the [[Death|dead]] surrounding the home of an up-and-coming politician. Upon investigation, evidence was revealed that they had put out several assassination contracts on their former rivals, and was swiftly arrested.
* A single night where several warehouses spontaneously went [[fire|ablaze]]. While nobody was ultimately injured, the warehouses were discovered to have been storing highly illegal drugs, and the one who happened to be the owner of said warehouses was then taken in for questioning.

Any other incidents that people may talk about are generally not recognized by officials as being officially related to the Invasion of Cats.

## Outcomes

As a minor consequence of the whole event, many locals (as well as a few members in government) began to treat the local cat population with more benevolence than usual. If questioned, the average answer is something along the lines of 'Just to be safe'.

There is also a rumor that the city guards have been secretly ordered to keep a constant eye out for a cloaked figure with amber eyes - especially if it seems like there are more cats in the city than there should be.
