People of [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]], subjects of the [[Bianca Nortia|empress]], heed this warning.

A [[Nortian Conspiracy|conspiracy of thirteen]] lies in the darkness, filling a void, a vacuum of its own design. They claim to act on behalf the empress, but examine closely the recent events and orders. You have been lied to for the better part of a year, a ruse ever increasing in magnitude pulling wool over a nation's eyes. Deceptions to force an iron grip on the seat of power, the person who sits in it, and the people who trusts them.

A [[Dragonic War|needless and bloody war]] has been ignited from the flint in the conspiracy's hand. Countless souls suffering, workers worked to the bone, all to serve a false idol.

The next week will be critical. Keep to yourself, keep your wits about you, investigate the lies you have been told, and heed only the word of those who speak of the [[Temple of the Uforiad|great dreaming one]].
