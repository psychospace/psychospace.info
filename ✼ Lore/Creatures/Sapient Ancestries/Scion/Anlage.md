**Anlage** (ahn-lah-jee) or **goliaths** are a #sapient ancestry, [[giant|giants]] born of heaven and [[earth]], and native of [[Nasc]]’s micro-gravitational biomes. They are born from second-generation [[Elemental creatures|elemental]] [[Scion|scions]], one of many myriad results of the coupling of [[Whill|whills]] and humanoids.

They are well known for being among the first peoples to develop [[Shindani]], the *lingua franca* of the Heavens.

# Properties
Perhaps the most noteworthy ability an anlage possesses is control over its size. Adults are able to shrink to 3 feet tall and grow to around 26, though usually, an anlage will prefer prefer somewhere between 6 and 10, and most lose their shapechanging ability as they grow into their middle age. 

Anlage also have some ability to manipulate their own senses: amplifying their sight when they must, or their hearing when they cannot see, for examples. An anlage's lifespan lasts around a millennium, though it will rarely be able to recall further back than the most recent century. 

For an unknown reason, despite their typically long lives, anlage have been perishing at higher and higher rates, and are so far unable to recoup their birthrates, due to the lower and lower numbers of anlage.

# Cultural views

Anlage are not known widely in the worlds below [[the Above]]: they often feel that typical gravity is ‘too heavy’ for them, or that their abilities often draw unwanted attention. Despite this, anlage have existed throughout the Wild Blue since the [[Age of Primordia]], and were particularly noteworthy on [[High Sacred]] in the era prior to the [[Carapa Republic]].

A noted exception to the secrecy, and likely the most famous anlage alive today, is the [[Black Queen]] — the present leader of the [[Coven of the Night]].

Some efforts have been made to reintegrate the anlage into other societies, whose form-changing prowess makes them ideal carpenters, guards, monster-hunters, and librarians, perhaps bizarrely.

Anlage society, especially in Nasc, typically places a powerful responsibility in the hands of parents, as they are expected to hold equal responsibility to raise each child born into the community, to the point that “trading” kids for a week or month is not uncommon. It ironically also considers anyone who tends the earth “parents” to their plants as well; the culture views it as truth that each generation is responsible for the generation after it in turn.
