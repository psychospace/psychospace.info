***Magical Mystery Tour***, also known as **MMT** or "**Campaign 1**", is a campaign in D&D5e which lasted from January 24th, 2020, until February 4th, 2024. It was Game Mastered by January November. 

In-universe, the adventure began in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], in the final month of [[1250 PT]], and followed the fraught events preceding and during the [[Dragonic War]], concerning the journeys of those connected to Prince [[Linnaeus Dino]]. It is the first game run in (and invented) [[The Heavens]].

# Arcs
## Arc 1 - "Nova"
In Arc 1, **Nova**, Linnaeus and [[Ildy]], stranded by a spontaneous [[Ghost storm|purple storm]], request the formation of an escort group to take them the long way home to [[Drastic]]. Beginning on [[1250 PT#12-11-1250|12-11-1250]], the party unites on the doorstep of the [[Maline Tower]]. Along their travels into [[Low Sacred]], they repeatedly encounter a dangerous cult known as [[Heartknock]]. At the end of the war, the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]] occurred, [[⎊ Hazel's Arrival|rendering Linnaeus]] on the verge of succumbing to his secret [[Dragonic Curse]]: and setting his friends on the path to revenge.
## Arc 2 - "Ephemeris"
In Arc 2, **Ephemeris**, a [[Lethal|mysterious individual]] who exactly resembles the kidnapped prince draws the party into a web of mysteries. As forces sprawl behind the invasion and the curse itself, the queen calls for [[Project Ephemeris|national cooperation]], and the [[S4]] is truly born as a collective. When [[Volk Vendleberg]] is kidnapped and assumed killed, and [[Chiave Neeman|Chiave]] stolen as part of some plan, the party embark to rescue their friends from [[Dom Otdykha]].
## Arc 3 - "Syzygy"
In Arc 3, **Syzygy**, all eyes are trained on the party's journeys to assemble the [[Golorr|Stone of Golorr]], an artifact which supposedly holds the hidden origins of the curse. As each of Ikabod's experiments are finding themselves, and old enemies crop up left and right, the hammer of the Heartknock fully unveils their role in the war effort during the [[Miraclesfield Experiment]].
## Arc 4 - "Apsis"
In Arc 4, **Apsis**, the last pieces of the stone are collected, leading to a reunion with the party's frenemy, Master [[Ikabod Caruso]]. Seeking repentance and discovering strange connections, the party gather themselves, as well as unexpected but persistent allies, into the final stretch, following ancient instructions for the revival of the [[Carapa Republic]] in order to wrangle the dragonic curse's source, [[Arahabaki]].
## Arc 5 - "Redshift"
In Arc 5, **Redshift**, the party embarks towards [[Yofora]] for their final mission to stop the Conspiracy, rescue and cure the ailing Linnaeus, end the war, and return both Nortia and Sacred to proper order.

## Opening Narration

>In this mighty world known as the Heavens, "disks" of earth, called remnants, remain floating amidst a sky of endless clouds. This world experienced an end, one way or another, long ago, but even that end is now an ancient start.
>
>Now all we have are the pieces of that shattered existence, which remain bound to us by the miraculous realm of psychological existence, simply called psychospace for short. From this realm came magic itself, and all its creations: truly, this place lives up to its divine title. It is impossible to know what exactly ended the world so long ago, but it is likely tied to the existence of psychospace...

>In the Year of the Lotus Broken, 1250 Pinwheel Tempo, on the remnant known as Sacred, a quest has sparked your interest.

>Prince Linnaeus "Linnie" Dino of Drastic, and his traveling companion Ildy, the eidolon guardian of Drastic, request adventurers as back-up as they prepare for the Summit of Sacred to occur on the dawn of the new year. While on their way to the edgeland settlement of Rainbow Ridge, supposedly to gather up guests for the summit, they lost much of their royal guard escorts to a peculiar magic storm, displaced to parts unknown. This follows a proclamation from the king a month prior, which has placed a temporary ban (or at least a strong warning) on teleportation magic due to this storm, which has yet to be understood by wizards.
>
>The remaining royal guardsmen are likely not enough should the storm cross paths with the Prince again; to replace the manpower, Ildy and the Prince have requested folks as guards and escorts back to Drastic. It seems the Prince is worried that another tragedy may befall his group upon their return, or maybe that is just the feeling you get.
>
>In exchange for this task, the Prince offers a gold prize, an offer of property in the capitol, his gratitude (which doesn't come easy), as well as guaranteed tickets to the Summit's events. In addition, the trip itself, along an alternate route back to the castle, will take several days and nights, during which they will be passing through several smaller towns in Sacred's lower half, which are rarely graced by the prince and are largely thought to be uncontrolled borderlands. The prince and the escort group will likely offer relief effort to those hit by the storm, as well as investigate any curiosities or strange happenings in each stop along the way.
