**Mount Celestia** is the [[flipside]] of [[High Sacred]], a powerful realm suffused with the influence of many law-aligned [[Divinity|gods]].

The birthplace of [[Angel|angels]] and resting place of the honored dead, Celestia is a surreal realm vastly covered by a vibrant craggy mountain range beyond mortal reckoning, not dissimilar in appearance to [the Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps). At the center of the structures is [[Iron Mountain]]. 

# Geography
As a place with heavy volcanic activity, places like the Core of Iron Peak are entirely inhospitable to any being not made of metal or golden ichor. Efforts of cartography have been successful, but any mortal caught approaching an angelic settlement too close is met with an almost overwhelming rejection. However, there has never been record of angels slaying any peaceful creature which trespasses on their grounds. 

Visual descriptions of these spaces from those who have seen such rejection describe them almost as though they are factories where golden-tinged souls walk freely.

# Inhabitants
The few stationed angels that regularly interact with humanoids are the wardens of the Void of [[Stygian]], though even these are known to be low-sphere grunts, whose featureless faces and loud, beating hearts held within and used for communication represent a friction between the familiar and the unknowable.
  
However, as is commonly attested with areas where [[Immortal|immortals]] and mortals share the same grounds, [[necromancy]] which traipses into souls living in Mount Celestia, removing them from duty or glory in their rest, likely marks you for death, and there are reports of suspicious disappearances nearby the [[Grand Watersea]] in connection with such events, as though death is loath to let go. It is these kinds of beliefs (among other aspects) that give necromancy its particularly poor reputation in High Sacred.
