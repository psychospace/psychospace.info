**Infantry Square** is a massive park in just about the center of [[Gateway]]'s castle-complex, surrounding a huge art piece depicting the victories achieved in the [[War of the Masters]].

# Art piece
Many floating bits of the statue represent islands in the [[Colossal Ocean]].

The Empress of [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] **[[Bianca Nortia]]**, King of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]] **[[Hadro Dino]]**, [[Pinwheel]]'s Imperator **[[Xenian]] the Observer**, [[Bullion]] Lord President **[[Gurvig Ursyna]]**, [[Dawndust]]'s Supreme Pontiff **Eis Meticast Andar-in**, and [[Archipel]] Bolyar **[[Kamikatsu Fukushiza]]-dono** sit in frozen discussion at the close of the War, with symbols of peace and of each country at the table: 
- the [[Star|star]] of Sacred
- the [[Temple of the Uforiad|temple]] of Nortia
- the orb of Pinwheel
- the teardrop of Archipel
- the basin of Dawndust
- and the [[The Shibboleth|tigerlily]] of Bullion. 

At the base of each side of the statue is Sacred's motto, "*Victory Most Sacred*", alongside the [[House Dino|Dino family]]'s [[House words|words]], "*Repent and Set Fire*", as well as a memorialization: 

>[!quote|txt-c no-t]
>*The End of the War; The Living Masters <br>- [[1217 PT]] -<br> In Remembrance of King Hadro.*

Statues of priests, soldiers bearing the victory star, [[Eidolon|eidolons]], and adventurers are found throughout the park, each memorializing specific heroes of Sacred within the hundred-year long war. These include all members of [[Critical Hit]], the eidolons at the time, [[Linnean Burgitsk|Linnean]] and Hadro, and others.
