**Silver** is a valuable gray, reflective metal. A **silver piece** (*sp*), a coin minted from silver, is a widely recognized currency throughout [[The Heavens]]. Different civilizations mint different types of coin, though these are usually pinned to the value of silver as a material. One silver piece can be split into ten [[copper piece|copper pieces]], and ten silver pieces make up a [[Gold piece|Gold piece]].

Silver has been standardized as a commonly accepted currency for thousands of years in many lands across [[The Heavens]]. The metal has impeccable utility, beauty, and association with [[Dragon|dragons]] aligned with good. Its natural properties align it with [[Vitality energy|positive energy]], and grant it a resistance to [[Fiend]] magic, monstrous creatures. and [[Curse|curses]], and silver powder is often used during [[Exorcism|exorcisms]]. These made it more stable as a currency, especially in areas suffused with potential fiendish influence.

Most economies deal with silver as the basis of their coinage.
