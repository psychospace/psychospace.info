A [[Discrepant]] [[phantom]] of [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto|Amakudari]] from the end of its days, known mythologically as "**the Promise** of Amakudari", appeared before it when it was still known as *Amazaki*. 

This phantom delivered the [[Divinity|gods]]' warning: Should the dragon return to [[The Planet]] where it was born to teach the people there its [[Gift of Stars|Gift]], it would never be allowed to leave again, or suffer dire consequences. 

Later on in its life, just in the instant a [[Void Breaker]] would claim its life, it traveled backwards along its [[Epitome|lifespan]] to deliver this warning and create this phantom, completing a [causal loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop).
