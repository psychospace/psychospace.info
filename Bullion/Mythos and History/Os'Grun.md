The **Os'Grun** was a meteorite which caused an epochal impact event on [[Bullion]] in [[BPT 12147]]. It was said to be the [[Divinity|divine]]'s answer to [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto|Amakudari]]'s actions.

The impact brought [[Ith'Paraan]] to an end, among other cataclysmic events, including the destruction of the ancestral capital of [[Emirate of Qaulhain#Temar|Temar]].
