[[Volk Vendleberg]]'s first quarry as part of the [[S4]], **Yang Lionshare** was a divining member of the [[Sacred Royal Ultra]] who supposedly predicted the events of [[Red Spark]] but fled his post instead of alert the correct authorities. 

He was spared by Volk, on the basis that Yang did not seem traitorous to the [[Kingdom of Sacred]].
