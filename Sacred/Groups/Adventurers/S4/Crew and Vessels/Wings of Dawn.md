***Wings of Dawn*** is a prototype [[Airship]] which acted as the upgraded form of the *[[Red Diamond]]* and the *[[Sun Chaser]]*, making her maiden voyage as part of the [[S4]]'s final mission to [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] near the end of the [[Dragonic War]], alongside the *[[Full Velocity]]*.

It is co-captained by [[Chadley Korol]] and [[Fera Illumin]], who both helped head up her new design, and served by the crews of both its component vessels. 
# Construction
Created as a prototype of the [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]] *[[Kaiju-class]]* airship, a [[Airship#Steelclad|steelclad]] intended to resist the [[Dustwall]] and travel safely using a [[Runic engine]], the ship repaired and replaced many components of the damaged *Red Diamond* and the many-years old *Sun Chaser*. 

It was constructed in the docks of [[Drastic]], after the *Sun Chaser* was towed from [[Port Fester]]. The effort was largely engineered by [[Kazumi Integra|Kazumi]] and [[Maccus Integra]], and paid for by royal edict under [[Project Ephemeris]]. 

Another ship, the *[[Skyfish]]*, which sat dilapidated in the [[S4t]], was also to be sourced for parts, but the ship would need to be repaired itself to be moved into its new dock, so the idea was ultimately scrapped.

## Name
The name, *Wings of Dawn*, was given to her by the S4 in reverence for the sacrifice of the spirit within the [[Wings of the End]]. Other suggested names include the *Wings of Waking Up In The Morning* (suggested by Chadley) and the *Prodigal Son* (suggested by [[Star of the North]]).
