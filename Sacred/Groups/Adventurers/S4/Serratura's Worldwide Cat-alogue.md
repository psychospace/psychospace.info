***Serratura's Worldwide Cat-alogue*** is an informational book compiled by [[Serratura Neeman]] on her travels around the world.

Created following [[1251 PT]], the book was one of many famous creations of the [[S4]] following their rise to fame throughout [[the Heavens]].

# Backstory

After the events of [[Zero Day]], as well as tying up a couple of loose ends with her friends in the S4, Serraturra Neeman quickly came to a rather quick discovery. Sure, she just finished a long and dangerous adventure - the sort of thing that maybe most people would be okay with experiencing only once before heading back home. However, with Serra, she found out that she had developed a taste for travel.

And thus, armed with the legendary sword [[Catclaw]] (and a promise to her loved ones to try to not get into too much deliberate trouble) Serra soon set out on an aimless journey through the Heavens. During this period of time, the rogue decided to start a journal of her travels - both so that she had a great memento afterwards, and to have a record of interesting things that she wants to show to her loved ones.

In time, this simple record would go from a single journal to several: perhaps due to Serra's penchant for mischief, as well as whatever influence the [[Cat Lord]] may have had on her, the rogue ended up getting involved in many adventures and shenanigans. This, in turn, allowed her to encounter many people, creatures, and magical artifacts that an average person could only dream about. In fact, whenever she happened to fill up her current journal, the rogue would send it to [[Arthur Graywell|Arthur]] - mostly in the hopes that the information would help the hobgoblin in his efforts of constructing a hero school.

While some historians in the distant future would probably call this record something incredibly formal, Serra would jokingly (though somewhat seriously) call it her 'Cat-alogue'. This was because, despite her intention to write about the variety of things she saw and experienced, Serra ended up filling most of her journals with detailed information about cats and other seemingly cat-related things.

# Contents
While the record itself is written in an extremely informal fashion - complete with side-tangents, doodles, and arbitrary observations - the sections where Serra takes the time to genuinely write about a creature or item she happened to encounter is incredibly insightful. Furthermore, if one takes the time to piece together where she was at certain points of time, they would realize that she may have had a hand in resolving (or, occasionally, _causing_) a lot of odd incidents throughout the Heavens - most of which tended to involve cats or cat-themed items in some way.

For example, it became widely agreed that Serraturra was definitely at the center of an extremely [[Invasion of Cats|unusual series of events]] in [[Pinwheel]] - especially after word spread that one of her journals almost exclusively detailed her actions and perspective during said events.

## Cat-like creatures

One of the few things that Serratura recorded consistently (and with great detail) was the variety of feline-shaped [[Creature|creatures]] she encountered. While she did see a large variety throughout the world, it appears that she saw the biggest concentration of them in Bullion. The following is a few excerpts of her encounters in [[Bullion]]:

* "Today I saw a very spiky-looking bobcat! It had spikes everywhere on its body, with these extremely large ones on its legs and tail - which means I probably shouldn't even try to pet it. Though, I did watch it slash open a cactus with its tail and drink the juices! I wonder if it's not a meat-eater? Eh, probably shouldn't find out the hard way."
* "I managed to track down a bunch of those [[magic]]-slinging cat creatures I heard about! They're pretty interesting - not only do they have magic and can speak in (kinda broken) [[Shindani|Common]], they're apparently amphibious and know some stuff about magic rituals! Though, at the same time, they were all kinda... extremely aggressive whenever the topic of religion came up. Especially [[Pantheon of Dawndust|Dawndust]] - yikes."
* "The other day I met this interesting black cat-person! I thought he was a [[Beastkin|shifter]] at first, but his actual form was really blurry, and I couldn't exactly tell what he really looked like other than 'black cat' and '[[human]](?)'. Anyways, we had a really good time swapping stories - though, apparently, he's got some sort of centuries-long feud with a local [[Witchcraft|witch]] who keeps trying to steal kids? I offered to help, but he said that it's his fight to deal with, and he just. Vanished. It was weird, but neat!"

## Artifacts and Items

Interestingly enough, Serratura wrote a lot about certain [[Infusion|magic items]] she encountered that seemed to have a [[Soul bond|connection]] to cats. 

In fact, at one point it seemed as if she went on a quest seeking out five specific items that had been scattered across the [[Mer de Vide]], with the exception of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]]. Much to the extreme ire of many scholars who specialize in magic items, it was eventually revealed that while Serra did end up finding these five objects, she seemingly 'got rid of them.' However, few people who were able to track her down for an explanation were met with a rather surprising answer: 

>[!quote | author] [[Serratura Neeman|Serratura]]
>"I mean, they're not destroyed, if that's what you're so worried about! But, uh, please don't try to recover them - they... kinda come with a nasty cost."

To date, Serratura refuses to tell anyone what exactly she did to those specific five, nor what this 'nasty cost' is. She has, however, given a basic description of these [[Antique|artifacts]]:
* A ring that allows its wearer to cast a version of Polymorph where the only options are some sort of feline.
* A necklace that lets the wearer summon a large cat as a battle
companion.
* A bracelet that, when activated, forms a large shadowy paw around
the wearer's hand, complete with magical sharp claws.
* A circlet that bestows its wearer with the ability to see in the
dark, as well as give them enhanced hearing and smell.
* A gemstone that looks like a lion's eye which releases a deafening roar when held aloft.
