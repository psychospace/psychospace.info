**Empty Lake** is a modern mythical town or colony rumored to exist somewhere in [[Bullion]], a hidden place of sanctuary from the constant threats of [[new magic]]. It was first told of by [[Numberless Children|Nulk]] literature, before being apparently confirmed by [[Sanza Rayo|Saint Rayo]].

 Though this rumor started small and initially emerged in [[Eleyda]], it has since ballooned in notoriety since the beginning of [[1285 PT]], as [[Halmer Kraig]], esteemed novelist, gunfighter, and showman, left a peculiar message with his publicist before disappearing:

>[!quote| author txt-c] [[Halmer Kraig|HK]]
>Dear Fans and Friends, 
> 
> I am taking my leave, and my family is coming with. We have been invited to a place of wondrous solitude and, preciously, quiet. We will live out the rest of our days here. 
> 
> Good bye. Tell all who hear you that the lake of inspiration is empty. Thank you for much, and I hope to see you someday.

 This was left at [[Pablo's Masterworks Publishing]], which published the note in the [[Daily Grind]], a newspaper covering many odd new-magic adjacent events.^[which grew massively in popularity when it covered the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]] back in '49] From there, the rumor took off like wildfire, eventually reaching many more ears.
 
 Some decided, after discovering that Kraig had already scheduled multiple events which would've occurred after he disappeared, that perhaps he did not leave of his own volition.
 
After Kraig's note alluded to the myth, many [[Wildwalker|gauchos]] new and old have begun to seek its location. The attention was enough that [[Sanza Rayo]], Saint of Light and [[Alect Keeper]], was willing to breach silence and make a rare public statement, telling the public to fear rumors of such "magical thinking".

# Views
Those who celebrate new magic, most commonly the [[Numberless Children]], see it as an aspirational holy land.

Those who despise or fear new magic instead see it as some kind of torturous scheme, where people like Kraig are being held hostage or killed.
