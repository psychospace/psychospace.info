In magical terminology, "**Light**" is a [[Psychospace|psychospacial]] property which is best described as the "purity" of [[Vibe]], wherever it exists in an area. Its most basic manifestation exists as pure illumination, hence its name.

Positive emotions, like friendship, loyalty, or kindness, improve the light in the vicinity. Negative emotions, such as hatred, violence, or enmity, diminish the light in the vicinity. This is the basics of the effects of the collective consciousness on psychospace.

The [[domain|domain]] of Light is interrelated with [[time]], and the flow of one leads to the flow of another

# Function
When Vibe is converted into a Material form, such as [[Mana]], or is tapped on for [[Magic|magical]] power, these processes rely on its Light levels. 

Light is what gives most [[Figment|figments]], such as [[Eidolon|eidolons]], their strength, based on the purity of the surrounding area. Powerful Light can be channeled through [[Vitality energy]]. 

Light can be more or less present in an area, resulting in effects to magic. The higher the purity, the more Light is condensed within an area. A light-aligned figment can die if it is devoid of Light, a condition aptly named *lightlessness*.

# Darkness
Vibe can exist with negative Light, forming **Darkness**, which is uniquely powerful in its own respect. This is what occurs when Vibe does not fill an area of psychospace completely, or if it is pushed away or consumed (such as by [[Cruel spells]]).

Darkness occurs naturally and most commonly within [[Soul|souls]], and those that can overcome their internal Darkness are able to harness magic. 

While its name may sound sinister, there is no *moral* distinction in its utility from its counterpart. Darkness has an important role in charging spells powered by [[soul bond|emotional connections]], such as [[Resurrection]] or [[Reality-Bending|reality-bending]]. Darkness is also used more passively in protective spells, as well as in illusions.
