**Jens "Jenks" Lamar** is a trickster dark-skinned [[Human]] man of 28, who uses a wand that can turn into a dagger. A member of the [[Adinah Ilacqua|Windriders]]. Has an owlbear cublet familiar named Chouette. Shy around strangers. Making new friends, however, is an important event to him.

Originally from the remnant of [[Umazia]], Janvier survived the harsh realities of working under Nortia's bootheel only barely with the help of [[Squiddly]] and [[Nat Andreas|Nat]]. In the Darkzone, Janvier was a dock worker, tasked with cleaning the decks of ships that had just returned from scouting.
