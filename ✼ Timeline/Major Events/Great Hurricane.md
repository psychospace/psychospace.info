The **Great Hurricane** was a colossal, historically-destructive [[Weather|storm]] system and natural disaster which occurred in [[Bullion]] in late [[1251 PT]]. Like many of the storm anomalies of that year, it was attributed to [[Zero Day]].

In the wake of the hurricane, some entire towns were soundly destroyed, including [[Zha'Zhana]] and [[Oscur]]. Collectively, it displaced an estimated 55% of the remnant's population, especially in population centers like [[Eleyda]], [[Castellan's Junction]], and [[Owohain]].

It devastated almost the entire remnant, forcing cleanup efforts and redevelopment which continues, in some places, even thirty years after its landfall. The [[Arkwright Improvement Company|Improvement Company]] was initially organized to assist in the restoration, though its reputation has turned dubious over the intervening decades.

# Path
Initially forming between [[Archipel]] and Bullion, the hurricane initially made landfall through [[Owohain]] and carved its path southwards along the mideast of Bullion, tracing the eastern coastline and flooding much of the [[Siella Valley]]. 

As it reached the [[Upper Kernwelt]], dry winds sent it tumbling westward, where it looped around and curved north, destroying parts of [[Raghain]] and [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qaulhain]]. It eventually faded and continued off-remnant as it reached the Laina Coast.
