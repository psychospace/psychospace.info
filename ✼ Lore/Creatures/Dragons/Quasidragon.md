A **quasidragon** is a dragon-like [[Figment]] which had its will, body, and form reduced to a manipulatable uniform state, known as a [[Core engine]]. These [[Soulstone|soulstones]] are usually created by [[magic]] (akin to *fabricate*) or by metamorphosing a powerful enough will into it, though draconid souls can also become quasidragons through a difficult and antiquated process.

Unlike pseudodragons, which are creatures directly imitating dragons, and faerie dragons, quasidragons are purely manmade, originally from genuine dragon souls and then later from immense concentrations of [[chaos]] energy. They are "technically" living creatures, but are truly soulless and replicable. 

Quasidragons receive sustenance from exposure to [[Elemental energy]].
