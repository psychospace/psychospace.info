![[âŽ‹ Needs Rewrite]]
Purple [[Tiefling]] boy, 19, blank white eyes. Black hair, horns seem trimmed. Thin tail. Slightly muscular; in good shape. Wearing an orange and red robe.

He planned to be a bard when he was younger, but ended up a low-ranking [[Victory Starscouts|starscout]] in [[Gateway]] for his strength. Upset with his job and feeling as if the Starscouts were dulling his wit and harming his emotional state, he was eventually abducted by [[Kingdle Fire]]. He was taken from Gateway about 2 months ago, and public records made by the V's report that he vanished within a cave. This is only partially true. 

He was taken into a cave, but Kingdle Fire has a weapon capable of creating flaming portals of some kind. Fire's words are scarred into his memory now, her promise that he would be "A master of his own destiny, in spite of whoever he is". The knuckle wounds are a symbol of self-denial: no matter who you are, you're made of the same stuff. Kingdle Fire's goal, as is the goal of the whole group by his reckoning, is to research the soul and find the "key to the heart's door", hence the name being the [[Heartknock]]: not a school of the traditional teaching sense, but instead a group of study for the soul's mysteries.

Magnet has a scar where he was fatally shot through by an eldritch blast by [[Alexios Hawthorne]]. He was later revived at the [[Destiny Cathedral]].
