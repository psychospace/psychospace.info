An **exorcism** is a rite of [[antimagic|antimagic]] which manifests as a practical, often faith-based means of [[Abjuration|abjuration]] for exterminating, expelling, or redirecting very powerful beings attached to [[Soul|souls]]. 

The goal of an exorcism is to remove or impugn an influence from the world which is hanging on with [[Magic#intent|intent]] alone. This can be anything from the lingering will of a [[ghost]] to the power-hungry [[Domain|monstrance]] of a [[fiend]]. 


# Cultural view
Exorcism is notable in use, at least in part for the lack of need for formalized training in [[magic]]. 

The forces and situations with which **exorcists** deal with do require professionalism and care, though, and so most priests across [[The Heavens]] learn one form or another of the craft. The rites are believed by some to be outdated as a first line of defense against malevolent influences, though its effectiveness in the right place or right time cannot be overstated.

However, many exorcisms are not performed correctly, or are assigned as a cure to a problem where its use does not apply[^1]. The outcomes of an improper or inappropriate exorcism can be traumatizing, in part because, without a proper target, an exorcism's resonance on [[Psychospace|psychospace]] might afflict or attack the [[Silver cord|silver cord]] of the "host" and cause a near-[[Death|Death]] experience. This danger is partly why it is not seen as favorably as it once was prior to the [[Pinwheel Tempo|Pinwheel epoch]].

[^1]: For example, a young [[Witchcraft|witch]] who [[Gift (witchcraft)|makes contact]] with a patron force might be exorcised, even though the [[Soul bond|connection]] will not be receptive to such an event.
