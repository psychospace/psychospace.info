**Life Line** is a magical dagger forged by [[Stoneshaper Ethel]], for use by an unknown [[Celestial]] [[Witchcraft|warlock]]. It is still wielded by said warlock, corrupted with odd energy, who currently acts under the name [[Ink of Angelblood]]. 

Its forging sealed Ethel's fate by binding him to the dread contract, and in revenge, he killed the warlock, but his fate was forever tied to the endless struggle of the righteous versus their sinners.

Peculiarly, it has no tip, and its hilt appears to be sculpted in the form of wings.

>>*Magic dagger, artifact, requires attunement*
>>
>>This weapon is considered silvered, and can be used as an arcane focus. Pact magic cast using this dagger as an arcane focus can ignore natural immunities to the damage type of its spells, such as immunities to poison, but it cannot ignore immunities from other effects, such as from arcane training or *globes of invulnerability*. Fire damage dealt by a spell cast with this dagger ignores resistances. Once attuned, the attuner becomes resistant to necrotic and radiant damage and receives corrupted angelic guidance.
>>
>>In addition, once per day, if the attuned creature is reduced to 0 hit points, the dagger bursts with [[celestial]] light and immediately restores half their hit points and wakes them. This, however, disables all of the effects below this one (although it does not break an active charm).
>>
>>When attacking a creature with Life Line, if the target has never been resurrected before, the attuner can gain advantage on the attack by listening to the guidance of a strange force. (Reincarnation does not count.)
>>
>>The angel's voice within the dagger draws heavy blood from mortal targets, and can also be used to "reform" them. On a critical hit, the dagger deals maximum damage on any target vulnerable to silvered weapons.
