A **bloodberry** is the round fruit of a **bloodberry plant**, the type species and most common variety of [[blood-flora]]. These spherical, orangeish berries grow numerous on long vines and carry a highly-dense reddish-purple sweet sap, which gives it its name, used in [[alchemy]] for medicinal purposes.

Also called "red-bombs" or "reddies", the berries themselves are popular staples of culture wherever its plants are found. As a succulent, the leaves of a bloodberry plant are what thicken and process the water which the plant absorbs, turning it into sap. 

The raw juices of the plant have a distinctively floral taste, containing innumerable seeds within the sap, though it must be prepared deliberately, as bloodberries are atypically able to process particularly-contaminated water, and thus may be toxic to imbibe.
