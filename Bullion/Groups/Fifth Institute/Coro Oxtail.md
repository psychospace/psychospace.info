**Coro Neonne Oxtail**, Special Adjunct, is a [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Freyite]] [[orc]] and high-profile [[songbird]]. A [[chirologist]] and [[Witchcraft|witch]] allied with the [[Fifth Institute]], she is sometimes regarded as a [[Lynchpin device|lynchpin]] or host to one.

She is currently the subject of study and a student herself at the [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qauli]] [[Institute Borderland Outpost]], which has been customized to facilitate her unique gifts -- specifically, that she moves about without respect to [[gravity]].

# Personality
Coro is extroverted and a friend to all at the laboratory, as well as extremely talkative in interviews. She assists in many areas of research, both with and without her gifts, and has been training to become a [[Sophist]]. However, she has [ornithophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithophobia) and [astraphobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astraphobia), two fears which do sometimes restrict what she is able to assist with.

Of all things, Coro despises violence and indecent caution, insisting that all those studied at the IBO be treated fairly and with respect. She also does not like to talk about the past.

# [[Codec]]: Burning in Atmosphere

As a [[Broadcaster]], she possesses the unenviable persistent ability which results in her having no ties to [[gravity]], a [[Codec]] she terms **Burning in Atmosphere**. Though originally believed to be entirely unconscious, and largely so, with practice Coro has been able to impart other objects with the nature of her existence, as well as restore some of her own weight with focus.

As with [[Sanza Rayo]], she has been given a special armor created by [[Meir Rayner]] to diminish the effects of her Codec. This has further restored some of her links to gravity, allowing her to travel and extend her abilities outwards in careful, retractable ways (such as for infiltration, or interaction with outsiders).
