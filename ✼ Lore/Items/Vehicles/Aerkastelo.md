The [[Magnificent-class]] dd-11 "**Aerkastelo**" was an [[Archipel]] [[Airship]] reported by [[Archipelian Thorns]] missing, perhaps pillaged and stolen or more likely crashed and destroyed, around the glaciers that surround [[Mount Culer]]. When [[Star of the North]] boarded the Aerkastelo, she was aboard when their course crossed the Precipice Plains in [[Low Sacred]].

The [[S4]] eventually prevented the ship from crashing into [[Cherryheart]], and her pirate crew was brought on board [[Heartknock]] who attacked the [[Tree of Time]].

Though it was going to be taken back to Archipel by [[The Unfortunate]], the ship was altogether lost following the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]].
