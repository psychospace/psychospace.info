Just north of [[Rainbow Ridge]] is a small artistic town known as **Lond Point**. The dirt here grows grass of an exceptionally green color, which inspired many painters and visionaries to live here. With its proximity to the [[Lond Swamp]], it also elicits a great deal of danger with the myriad monsters. So, in short, it's both a town of adventurers and visionaries.

This town is relatively new, and came to be a more notable settlement when [[Drachedion Balthazar]] decided to construct his manor, [[Puzzledam]], north of it. Its staff were given housing here and many people flocked to visit the architectural wonder.
