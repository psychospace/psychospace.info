The **elseworld**, also called the **dark world** or **shadow realm**, is a [[Plane#Sphere|sphere]] which manifests as the grim "dual" [[Echo|shadow]] of [[The Planet|the Planet]]: its mirror image, darkened and distorted by tricks of the light. It exists on an alternate [[worldline]] to the Heavens^[At least, "alternate", from this wiki's primary subject matter.]. 

Though known about in various forms and by various names for centuries, it only became truly apparent to the everyman in the reflection of the planet which appears in the [[Sky-scrape|sky-scrape]]. Study of the elseworld is known as **transworld philosophy**.


# Properties
The elseworld resembles the familiar Planet in superficial ways, but on the brink of total annihilation, as part of a [[TPK]] which seemed to occur in [[616 E-PT]]. Its equivalent to [[psychospace|psychospace]], what is left in the wake of its annihilation, is known as [[Necrospace|necrospace]]. It is bonded to the Heavens through [[The Fortress|the Fortress]].

Much of society and mortality, as the denizens of the [[The Heavens|Heavens]] understand them, have effectively collapsed, with the [[Divinity|divines]] difficult to reach and punishment effectively eternal. 

Were the planar stack maintained, it would be evident that the elseworld at one point were exactly like the Planet, containing else-forms of the [[Scarlet Skies]], [[Dark Sea]], [[The Above|Above]], [[The Below|Below]], [[Väräh]], and [[Umbraid]]. Due to the TPK, however, all of the individualized [[gravity]] of their [[Remnant|remnants]] have collapsed.

## Mutability
As the reflection of the Planet, many places which existed at the time of the TPK remain, though in confused, complex, and often nonsensical shapes, all made harder to navigate via a persistent lack of [[star|starlight]] in the sky.  

It is likely that as psychospace changes, so too does the nature of what it would mean for it to collapse, and so the shape of this plane is wildly dependent on the era of its landscape's origin.


## Else-Lynchpins

The elseworld contains its own [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpins]], though evidently these have failed and have even been understood to have lost magic in certain cases. 

It is believed by some that only the most holy of devices remain there, with no [[Lynchpin device#^858a3c|iteration process]] allowing them to continue through the ages.

## [[Portal|Portals]]
Sometimes, [[Confluence|confluxes]] created by the reflective nature of the elseworld cause its influence to traipse into and out of relevance in the Heavens. Many inhabitants of the elseworld are, in fact, natives of the Heavens, who slip through these confluxes into the reflected world. 

If one leaves the elseworld, their shadow or reflection is likely to come with them in a literal, individualized sense, given a newfound purpose through witnessing the other place.[^2]

## Inhabitants

### Kayal
The sapient denizens of the elseworld call themselves *kayals*[^1], and almost all of them are [[fetchling|fetchlings]]. [[Void energy]] festers, and it is believed by the myriad (though dwindling) population of the elseworld that the gods have long since turned their backs on them. 

Only some communities remain, only maintaining rough senses of "logic" through powerful beings (such as [[Uforia]]) or forces continually spread throughout the ages. Outside of these small spaces of influence, danger lurks around every corner, threatening what little true life remains.

In some urban dwellings flush with still-potent memories, such as the largest and most noteworthy city of [[Else-Orkrengrad]], some still hope to find some way to restore the elseworld's severed link to [[Mana (plane)|Arcadia]]. For most younger *kayals*, this is seen as a pointless effort, especially when [[Light (property)#Darkness|Darkness]] offers a calm and familiar protection and guiding hand, something that they never received through its counterpart.

### Lawless
In the vacuum of power presented by a lack of divine care, entities (kind and malevolent alike) have taken root in the elseworld's versions of many other planes.

Chief among the most notable and destructive of these forces are the [[Nightshade|nightshades]], strange [[Aberration|aberrations]] borne of pure entropy which utterly eradicate all that passes them.
# History
According to notes, [[Viers Callinan]] was able to identify and utilize a stable point of contact with the elseworld, probably through another lynchpin which goes unidentified.

[[L'ipotesi]] covers an else-lynchpin in the care of the [[Fifth Institute]], supposedly from this alternate world's version of [[Aet'Caldwyn]].

It was the connection of the elseworld to the real world that led [[Illarion Parasom]] to posit that both sides of the mirror would soon resemble each other.

[^1]:  *Kayal* is an ancient [[Draconic]] phrase which means "archetypal", and by direct descendant an older form of the term [[aphorite|aphorite]]. This is supposedly a term these native descendants use as a protective turn of phrase, hoping that what lingering, dangerously fleeting form of [[Logic]] might spare them complete "deletion" from the [[universe]] if they speak into existence that they are essential pieces of it.
[^2]: For example, when a toddler [[Amanita Parasom]] glimpsed the elseworld through a dream of the dark from her [[quori|quori]] guide, her nascent shadow took on a protective spirit, and split, becoming [[Octavia Parasom]].
