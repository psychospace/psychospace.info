A **hexicon** is a collection of [[Spell|spells]] and knowledge of [[magic]], typically of a particular study -- the inventory of its terms, concepts, and properties, necessary for spellcraft. 

It is the magician's equivalent to a [lexicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicon)^[Its name is a portmanteau of *[[hex]]* and *lexicon*.] and is colloquially known as a **spell list**. 

# Uses
There are two general forms of hexicons: open and closed. They vary based on whether or not they are .

Open hexicons are available for additional research and appending. They are used by formally-trained casters to avoid doing redundant work where it can be avoided. For example, if one person has already figured out the necessary equations for a [[fireball]], then an open hexicon will help further the process of someone [[Viewpoint property|recreating]] the spell for themselves, without need for a [[scroll]] or replication.

Closed hexicons recognize that this is impeccably dangerous, given the broad powers that magic can employ. A closed hexicon keeps spells catalogued, ensuring discoveries are demarcated, but special permission is needed to uncover any materials associated with its spells. These are by far the more common of the two.

These forms are often mixed, such as within an arcane school, which will allow students access to certain research information once their studies have progressed past that point.

## Proper
Broadly, *"the"* hexicon (sometimes capitalized as a proper noun) refers to collective understanding of all of known [[Magic#Cast|cast magic]]^[Or, at least, all of known "old" magic, as [[new magic]]'s spontaneity is difficult to categorize.].

## Law
Hexicons are also commonly compiled to detail the legal use of magic, within a certain jurisdiction. 

Existing at the intersection of ethics, [[psionics]], and law, nearly every modern [[Remnant|remnantal]] authority keeps a legal hexicon, though the application of a hexicon varies from place to place. 

For example, [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]] has a singular hexicon kept within the [[Sanctum Most Sacred]] which applies to both its remnants, while [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] has hexicons that vary in minor ways between each of its oblasts.

Typically a legal hexicon lacks power to be enforced outside of settlements. Following the dawn of the [[Age of Adventurers]], legal hexicons occasionally enforce selection from specific spell-lists on adventurers, adherence to which ensures their legal protections are not revoked. ^bdd40c
