**Unwri** (*ahn-ree*), also called the **Nexial Cathedral**, is a [[Remnant|Hell]] which acts as the court of the [[Death|dead]] and home of [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]]. Beneath the cosmic spire which marks its center, many listless souls congregate as the bureaucracy of managing the underworld sometimes takes eons to sort out. Only a soul with a *[[Fylgja|fylgja]]* can reach such a place.

From there, [[Exponen]] (under her name as **Nexos**) and the [[Avatar of Death]] act as the judge of all [[Soul|souls]], weighing each's deeds accordingly and sending them as [[Petitioner|petitioners]] to the appropriate resting place. 

This place, outside of the influence of [[Logic]], acts as the uncrossable bridge between [[The Heavens]] and [[Welkin]]. Some theorize it is where the influence of the [[Divinity|gods]] altogether can be attributed to.
