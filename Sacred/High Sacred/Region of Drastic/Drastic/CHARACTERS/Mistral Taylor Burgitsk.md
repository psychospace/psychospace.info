**Mistral Taylor Altta-Asker Burgitsk** is the [[Tiefling]] chief advisor and Royal Officiant of the whole of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], granted a sort of boon by [[Athemat]] allowing them to not age while sleeping. Comes from [[House Burgitsk]]. Her father was [[Linnean Burgitsk]], the previous royal advisor who ended up being the namesake of the new prince.

Her aunt is [[Cefal]], the Crownshield, although through the mutant trial she forsook her previous blood and is now only an "honorary" member of her family. Her great aunt is [[Wandar Burgitsk]], current matriarch of the House.

Her pronouns are she/them. Mistral is about 37.
