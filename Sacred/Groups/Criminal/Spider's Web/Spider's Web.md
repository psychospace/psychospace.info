The **Spider's Web** is a criminal network in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] that primarily deals with black market and hits, but whose influence is felt throughout the underworld.

It was run by [[Tali'Zorah vas Vakarian]], and is lorded over by the [[Trinity Seven]].

# History
It arose some 100 years ago out of a desire to unite the money and assist in subversion of Sacred's [[Kingdom of Sacred|government]] and safety, advocating war for business. It is likely partly their handiwork that the Kingdom spent so long wrapped in the [[War of the Masters]].

# Recruitment

To join the Spiders, you need to prove your worth. This usually involves completing a mission solo, passing a test one of the lieutenants made, or they just welcome you in and the moment you mess something up - you're gone.

Subtlety and privacy are respected in this organization. No one pries into anyone's business unless the other wants to divulge, people keep things discreet and simple, and everyone trusts each other to not betray the organization. Some join the Web through blackmail, some join because they want to, some join because a lieutenant spotted someone's potential. No matter how you join, once you're in, you're in for life and you cannot leave.

If you try to leave for any reason aside from retirement, you are killed. If you are even suspected of leaving, you will be tortured. Killing someone in the organization is fine... unless they're a higher up, then you have a bounty on your back... and a hefty one at that.

# Structure
Comprised of seven clans:

-   **The Cocoon**: Represents the lowest order of the network, the Cocoon offer deals to those who are "unwanted" by society, for example those in desire of [[Gold piece|gold]] or money. Overseen by [[Igor Ingolstadt|Igor]].
-   **The Farm**: Operates and runs a black market. Overseen by [[Dystikos Bhitargrarh]].
-   **The Nest**: Trains mercenaries. Overseen by [[Xiaotian]].
-   **The Hive**: Trains assassins. Overseen by [[Varendra Romata]]. Valain is a member.
-   **The Vivarium**: An odd branch that is best defined as the "runners", they transport goods and create lines of communication between branches. Their leader, [[Fritz Zbinden]], is said to be the most vicious of the Trinity Seven.
-   **The Brood:** Trains spies. Overseen by [[Darwill Clobbaskull]].
-   **The Tangle**: Oversees the entirety of the organization: the Trinity Seven's members are selected from here. Overseen by [[Loppe Blankley Larrea]].
