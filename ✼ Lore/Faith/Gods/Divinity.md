A higher-being dwelling in the [[Welkin]] is known as a **divine**, or, more often, a "**god**" or "**goddess**". Such beings are widely considered [[immortal]] by any sensible reckoning, even though gods are known to occasionally die and be reborn. 

On [[the Planet]] and within the [[Antic Sea]], these higher-beings are the authors of the [[Divine Equation]]. A being is only truly divine if it  and are all bound by the [[Zero-Draw]] Rule.

# Alignment
As with their immortal servitors, in modernity, divines are generally considered along specific moral binds, as well as between [[chaos]] and their [[logic]] (between decision-making and decision itself). These are defined along two axes: one of favoring evil and good, and one of favoring law or chaos.

# Pantheon

Though many divine and near-divine entities exist, the most commonly worshipped groups of gods are known as **pantheons** (variously translated from an [[Apocrypha of Winds|apocryphal]] phrase of "all-the-gods"). 

Within most of the world, one most commonly worshipped pantheon is [[Pantheon of Dawndust|the one]] normalized by [[Dawndust]], seen below.
