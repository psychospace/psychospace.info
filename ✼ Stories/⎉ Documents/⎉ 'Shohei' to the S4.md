Thou hast continued to subvert destiny: a pleasant surprise, indeed.

[[Nortian Conspiracy|The CONSPIRACY]] are thirteen in number, a pack of roiling insects each. The count is a sham prophecy they have convinced themselves a truth. Motivations more grand and disturbed than any mortal, even I, can understand, and their controller has assumed themself the victor over both lands. There is only damned SCARLET to be found at the heart of darkness beneath their cloaks of black snakeskin.

Ah, and I am one to talk. I walk [[Kingdom of Sacred|a foreign land]] behind a stranger's face, as they do. PEACE is what I stake my life for, hold: yet, am I so much better? It is a thought I am much discomforted by.

And so it is as you have seen: with [[Elain Valaransia|the FIREFLY]] caught in [[Red Spark#^50937b|an ember]] and extinguished, [[Chiave Neeman|the MOTH]] was jarred to replace it, meant to flock to their artifice of a light. When the moth turned from the darkness to the warmth of family, another stole the place. A deep cesspit of flies, they are: infinite contingencies extant to even my arcane ability.

Their truest thirteenth is wicked, [[Valain Stalwart|a wily SPIDER]] that trawls for gold among carrion. He has no deep intellectual morals, yet he is principled: only might in greed and gut drives him. Battle is just games to him: he crawls to his ilk. He needs no [[Shiny Mask|mask]] to call his name, only cause.Â 

Run, you must, from the spider. He's nothing to lose. The one of you who will not run must then never need to run in the first place. I hope you understand the meaning of those words when they become your lifeline.

HOPE exists with the end of a life. Yet there shall come a time when new life, too, arises a dawn of hope for all to see.

You are the ones who can bring this day forth. This war shall end, some day soon. And when you soon quest for [[Yofora|my HOME]], I will be there to help lay bare the mystery of the tragedies we have both suffered.

You will lift the [[Dragonic Curse|curse]], so long as hope burns in your HEARTS.

I'll see you all soon. Promise.
