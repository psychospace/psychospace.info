**Qualuci** is a late-[[Oa'Rovi|Primordial]] era town in [[High Sacred]]. holds some of the most interesting, yet most fleeting history. Constructed north of the [[Soulspring]], it is called "High Sacred's [[Wisfer]]" for no small reason.

A certain eccentric businessorc has set up shop here, taking people through an old haunted home.

Qualuci is named for "Qual'ousi", roughly Terran for "position of danger." It is said to be named this for the Primordial-speaking tribes who made first landing there (aboard dragons) did not wish to return, and desired to mark this to recall later, after they had moved further east. This is likely due to the war in that region between fiends and celestials, which would make settling there quite difficult.
