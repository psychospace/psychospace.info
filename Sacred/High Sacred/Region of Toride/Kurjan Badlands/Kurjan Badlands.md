The **Kurjan Badlands** are an ancient place, a mountainous taiga filled with pines and rock scarred black and white by old weaponry, once saw direct conflict between fiends and celestials, twisting its landscape forevermore. 

Along its middle point is the [[Vale of Battle]], a long and treacherous path throughout the whole of the Badlands, stretching from [[Grand Watersea|the Watersea]] to the [[Mare del Monte|Skysea]], and many of its landmarks, just like those on a battle map, are recalled and orientated relating to their distance north or south of the line. There is a poisonous air to [[Psychospace]] in this region, making the whole place feel as if that conflict never ended, that there are distant explosions of hellfire and full-voiced choirs portending doom to sinners still echoing throughout the hills and trees.

# History

In ancient times, tribal nations of [[anlage]], descendants of the [[First Magicians]], catalogued the battles here in legendary myths. The even-more-ancient history of the [[Blood War]]'s further clashes for hold of this region are now mere folklore, but using new sciences, some believe the history is coded into psychospace and can be ascertained from the scars left behind.

# Etymology

The term "Kurjan" is derived from "Kurja", an [[Infernal]] word meaning "Wretched" or "Unwanted", referring to the inevitable failure of the fiends to claim a [[Celestial]]-infused land, as well as the celestials' offensive itself nearly being routed by the fall of a spark of [[Blackflame]]. Artifacts from the Badlands are often called "Kurjan", as beyond the bounds of [[Zuth'Yarl]] and the farther north late-Primordial town of [[Qualuci]], no other permanent Primordial cities are known to have existed here.
