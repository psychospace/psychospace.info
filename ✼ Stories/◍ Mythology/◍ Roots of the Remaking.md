>[!quote|subt author] Kshhshksa, protean preacher _translated from [[Oa'Rovi]]_
>"When Chaos consumed aught, there were but three fundamental forces that formed a shattered zeitgeist of the Not-Where that now but one [[The Maker|entity]] dwelled within.
>
>The Force of Existence, [[chaos|CHAOS]], instructed that the world is forever made, and that this world was made up of things. 
>
>The Force of Causation, [[Logic|FATE]], instructed that the things in this world moved, and that this movement upheld certain rules. 
>
>The Force of Multeity, [[Gravity|GRAVITY]], instructed that this world was a distinctive physicality, in [[Plane|deviation]] from its [[Chartless Sea|Origin Point]].
>
>
>Chaos was the truth of Existence, and logic hoped only to give that Existence a passive intent. Fate relied on chaos to form constancy. Chaos was purity, absolute energy, and absolute activity. 
>
>Only through the observation of activity can one observe passivity. The [[Manifold Seas|light of the skies]] reveals this very truth. Only as a mistake — a negligence of Chaos itselves — did the mind come to govern [[psychospace|so much]]. 
>
>The [[Divinity|gods]] hiding in their [[Cien|star]] may fear this — [[The Gathering|trample it]] where they can as they must — yet they know all-too-well who their masters are."
