Also called "The Burning Rainbow", **Mynos** is the goddess of entitlement, birth, widows, orphans, and peace in chaos. In the world, there are things which should not have lived. Mynos acts a kind mother to such creatures, when those creatures have no mothers to return to.

A true child of [[Athemat]], Mynos was stoned as a child by her father for stealing from her sister [[Prus]], and was said to have died. She might have were it not for her five headed form â€” her abominable nature allowing her will to live to surge forth. She presides over a [[Scarlet Skies|Scarlet Sky]] in the form of a mighty five-headed dragon.

After her "death", her previous body came back as the son of Athemat known as [[Gebra]].
