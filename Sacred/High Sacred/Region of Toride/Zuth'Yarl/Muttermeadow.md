**Muttermeadow** is the botched [[Shindani]] name for an ancient stronghold located beneath [[Zuth'Yarl]] which would have allowed the originators of the region (most likely, angels) to conceal their populace deep beneath the earth in safe tunnels, in case a battle was fought over the town. More accurately, its name could be translated as "New Babel".

If the [[Carapa Republic|Carapaean]] Contingency had more time, a third Vault, the Vault of Forever, would have been placed here as part of an Installation (not dissimilar to [[Installation S.H.O.R.E.]]). Like its Low Sacred sister site, it would have housed a large storehouse of powerful weapons. In a sense, it was left half finished, although that half of the work had predated them.

It is an "autonomous" dungeon which uses pools of [[Celestial]] energy to constantly iterate and refactor itself. Despite its capabilities and purpose, it has a number of design faults, which Sacred is investigating to use in its own structures. Unfortunately, these features are not so faulty that it does not ever prevent the return of an explorer who willingly delves into it.
