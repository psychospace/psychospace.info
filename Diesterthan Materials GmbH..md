**Diesterthan Materials GmbH** is a materials corporation founded by [[Devil|devils]] from the [[Scarlet Skies]]. The company name is often shortened to  **DMAT**, their [[Scarlet Holdings Market]] identifier. They are mainly known for supplying massive quantities of [[noemite]] around the planet for experimentation and production of [[Verlan|verlan]]. Through their colossal mining operation on [[Little Candid]], they have also been a leading developer in autonomous verlan systems and logistics. 
# Founding
DMAT was founded in [[1142 PT]] by a group of devils who collectively signed on a charter to form the company. Its purpose was to supply the then dwindling market for materials to the [[Fiend|fiends]] of the Scarlet Skies. The Skies' lack of substantial raw material exports due to its vast ashen wastelands and lack of trade with other [[Plane|planes]] made the market wide open to new entrepreneurs. 
# Notable Contributions
## Mass-Produced Automatons
The natural inhabitants [[Väräh]] are generally hostile towards organic beings, so DMAT needed metallic workers to carry out labor on [[Little Candid]]. While not sold publicly, many denizens of the Scarlet Skies are aware of the automatons as DMAT often shows them in advertisements and promotional material. They are produced in a wide range of forms and functions from foundry workers to giant industrial cranes. 
## [[Noemite#Diestermite|Diestermite]]
DMAT invented their staple alloy to fuel the expansion of their automated systems. Diestermite is used in nearly every aspect of DMAT's operation as a networking medium. Due to the highly networked nature of their operation, most items manufactured by DMAT for internal use have a significant quantity of Diestermite.
Diestermite is also one of DMAT's main exports. Due to the general rise in demand for verlanic systems, some have opted for DMAT's direct-contact implementation of [[Dust tunnel|dust tunnel]] propagation. 
# DMAT Automatons
DMAT produces a very wide range of automatic entities, also called network nodes or just nodes. Their name comes from their connection to DMAT's verlanic network, each entity being a node on the network. Only a small portion of the nodes would be considered "automatons" by most, as all the others have very simple functions without much thought or judgement if at all.
## Interconnectedness
DMAT's internal network called the Autonet connects all of their nodes together. Physically, every node has some kind of wired connection to a nearby hub of wires. Where the wire connects to the node depends on their design. Certain nodes are allowed to disconnect themselves from the network for short periods of time in case they are relocating a short distance without any connection points along the way. 
Within the Autonet, nodes are able to pass messages to one another. Most messages are operationally relevant, meaning they directly impact DMAT's operation on Little Candid. Some of the messages, however, are between higher-intelligence nodes that are communicating socially. This social communication is highly monitored and restricted by DMAT, but is generally permitted to improve the mood and efficiency of the nodes. In essence, DMAT is allowing them to form friendships and connections to improve their moods and in turn their work improves as well. 
## Intelligence and Emotions
Some nodes are given higher intelligence and basic capacities for emotion. Broadly speaking, these nodes are considered to be automatons as they are able to think, feel, and decide for themselves. Their intelligence and emotions are powered by abstract micro-verlanic systems called cores. Most automatons are given one to four cores, depending on their function set. A special exception to this case are the [[Iensehr|iensehrs]], which are given up to 10 cores depending on their design iteration. 
# Timeline - First Iteration
## Early Years
The initial signatories of DMAT's charter set to build up a materials company to fill a hole in the market. They began by doing simple prospecting jobs around several Hells, finding a few decent veins here an there, but mostly sifting through ash and debris. Any ore they did find was sold raw directly to foundries; DMAT did not own any in-house ore processing.
After a few months of low-yield veins, they began to research how to turn the common dust and ash of the Hells into a higher grade building material. Their goal was something along the lines of brick and mortar or similar. They purchased a lease to a small building space and converted it to a lab, and hired a few scientists to work in it.
## Kimble Cache
On [[1145 PT]] The DMAT prospecting team found a promising vein of ore on (remnant name), a Hell which (remnant notoriety). After further investigation, the team determined that the vein spanned a significant portion of the remnant. This vein would be known to be the **Kimble Cache**, named after Stewart Kimble, the person who found it. 
It was positioned in such a way that the segmented portion of the remnant would become structurally unstable should significant extraction take place. With complete disregard for these warnings and greed in mind, the signatories quickly shifted all operations to extract the ore. They also began throwing money at covering up publicity to prevent competitors from staking out their claim. 
## Internal Growth
With revenue skyrocketing, DMAT began to expand their operations. During [[1147 PT]] - [[1161 PT]],  DMAT was opening more research facilities, building foundries local to the Kimble Cache, and setting up in-house logistics. They slowly expanded into a moderately sized company making incredible profits due to the great margins on the materials market. 
## Injel
With the new facilities, they onboarded more and more skilled and intelligent researchers and engineers. In [[1160 PT]], a group of researchers formulated a mid-grade building material consisting mostly of mining byproduct aggregate. This material, known as [[Ingelfurous Sediment]] or just ingel, had its first real application the same year it was formulated. It was used to create a small road for wheelbarrow transport and was received with raving reviews. The ingel produced a reasonably flat surface without needing to be stomped down like dirt, while also being weather-resistant. DMAT quickly scaled the production of injel and began using it everywhere. Roads, foundations, even the buildings themselves began to trade expensive brick, wood, and sheet metal for the cheap and structurally sound injel. 
## Corporate Unrest
Starting around [[1167 PT]], DMAT started to attract attention from large scale corporate entities that exist in the Scarlet Skies. Namely [[Avarice Corp.]] (AVC), who was the largest holdings group consisting of hundreds of subsidiaries controlling many aspects of life in the Scarlet Skies. By infiltrating corporate spies into DMAT's corporate ladder, they were able to have lots of insider knowledge about DMAT. Most notably, ways to exploit DMAT's deeds of the land surrounding the Kimble Cache. 
Getting their guard up, DMAT began to raise a private military comprised of any mercenaries they could find and placing squads of them around key locations in fear of direct physical takeovers. AVC responded with their own in-house troops. Highly trained and regimented with a full internal command system, DMAT and its troops stood very little chance without more help. 
## War Served Cold
Around [[1170 PT]], DMAT saw conflict as an inevitability. They enlisted the aid of [[Willings Defense Group]], a private military company to bolster their troops. With troop presence growing on both sides around key locations, one could mistake DMAT's foundries for garrisons. AVC too had their own bases set up, though more directly as military bases. This arms accumulation eventually reached a breaking point in [[1171 PT]] when an Willings Defense troop accidentally fell into a trench, invading on enemy territory, and starting a conflict. As word spread up the chain about this battle, the war turned hot. While Scarlidian corporate wars are very common and often lost to the history books, this one would be remembered as [[Diesterthan's Trial]]. 
## Endless Struggle
Combat broke out amongst most DMAT locations, but the harshest front was the [[Holdout at Kimble Cache]]. Many hundreds of casualties taken every month for years there alone, all while normal (though throttled) mining operations continued. DMAT *did* generally have the upper hand having fortified encampments and stationary artillery emplacements which helped keep AVC troops at bay. 
And so the spiral of war ever grew. Both sides enlisted more people for more troops. DMAT took an extreme measure by acquiring Willings Defense in whole to reduce bureaucratic friction between the two companies. AVC expanded their recruiting and propaganda machine to attract more souls willing to die for a small sum of money. This endless cycle continued for an incredible twenty-three years with some low and high points and the occasional cease-fire. 
In the process, many DMAT facilities were raided, wiped out, or otherwise destroyed. Notably, near the end of the war the Kimble Cache was sabotaged by AVC. By detonating a series of high-yield explosives within the mines, the already damaged thread holding that part of the remnant together was sent tumbling into [[The Below]]. Nobody cared to look for survivors. 
## Defeat
In [[1204 PT]], AVC proved its tactical and manpower superiority, maintaining its seat at the top of Scarlidian corporations. They offered DMAT a deal: Surrender all properties and operations and end the bloodshed. The terms of the deal were complicated, but it would leave DMAT limping by on a single airship with but a handful of change to its name. Seeing this to be the best course of action of the company, the remaining signatories agreed to the deal, handing over nearly all of DMAT's physical wealth and property. Many more signatories left the contract soon after. 
## Corporate Slumber
The long dark period for DMAT spanning [[1204 PT]] to [[1251 PT]] was spent scraping at the Hells for any opportunity to catch a break, but only the same Hellish ash and dust was free for claiming. The only two people who remained at DMAT were [[Halzion Humerforia]] and his [[Scion|scion]] daughter, [[Makail Humerforia]]. They spent their time trawling through the ash on their ship, [[The Wise Candid]]. Halzion taught Makail everything he knew about operating a business, his successes and shortcomings, and urged Makail to maintain DMAT. Soon after, Halzion left the contract to pursue other ventures. He maintained contact with Makail as her business advisor and father figure.
# Timeline - Second Iteration
## New Materials
After [[Zero Day]] and the reemergence of [[Väräh]], Makail set off to prospect the new riches that the elemental plane of metal brought with it. Sure enough, she was the first one to land and claim land on a remnant she named [[Little Candid]], after her ship. Using all of the remaining corporate savings, she enlisted a previous member of DMAT to help her set up a mining operation on Little Candid. While the devils were generally adverse to the atmospheric silver on the remnant, Makail was able to make extended stays and oversee the operation herself. 
## Second Growth Mimics the First
Nearly all prospecting jobs turned up extremely rich and dense veins of ore most notably containing [[Noemite]]. Makail took after DMAT's first business iteration as a success; starting off small by selling raw ores to foundries, then setting up internal foundries and logistics. This time, however, DMAT grew exponentially faster. While the previous material market had good margins, the rising demand for [[Verlan|verlan]] gave rise to demand in noemite, skyrocketing DMAT's growth once more. 
## Hazardous Environments
Varah is ill-suited to organic life. Its natural denizens consist of metallic beings with razor-sharp defensive features and aggressive mannerisms. While dangerous, Makail saw this as both an opportunity and a challenge. From the scraps of old DMAT, she assembled a team of highly skilled engineers to begin development of automated, metallic systems to take the place of organic laborers. With a bottomless supply of noemite at their fingertips and an excellent position to conduct testing, they were quickly able to begin replacing workers with automated machines.
## Automatons
DMAT's automatons started out as very simple animated beings. Automatic minecarts, power-lifting gates, and simple things of that nature. With their ever increasing budget along with  unregulated development, the R&D team began getting more complicated with their designs. Mining units that were compact and extracted veins, surveillance drones that detect and neutralize natural threats, and automated logistics optimizers are just a few examples. Unknown to them at the time, these automatons would form the new basis and brand for DMAT. 
## Automatic Revolution
A verlan network was developed to connect all automatons together for highly streamlined communication using [[Noemite#Diestermite||Diestermite]]. A whole communication protocol which ran across the network would eventually form the basis of [[Signalian]]. To keep up with these advancements, DMAT made the automatons even more intelligent, more capacity for thought and judgement, and more individuality. 
They were smart, however. To keep the automatons in line, R&D implemented several safety nets. First, the automatons were given a basic capacity for emotion. This is often leveraged to dole out punishments to anyone misbehaving. Second, network communication was made to be highly controlled and monitored. While operational communication was unfettered, interpersonal social communication was checked under a watchful eye (by an automatic system, of course). Third, a special kind of Automaton called the [[Iensehr]] was produced to be a boots on the ground supervisor of the workforce.
## Boundless Growth
From [[1265 PT]] to [[1280 PT]], DMAT continued to grow at a staggering rate, quickly covering the entirety of Little Candid in mines and foundaries. A logistical marvel coated the landscape; there is scarcely a spot that escapes the reach of rails, communication lines, factories, or airships. DMAT has once again reached a point of comfort and stability.
## Mutiny
That was the case until something strange happened. All of the automatons employed by DMAT began to march at once through the logistic network. There was panic to have everything shut down, but it seemed to the operators that they had no control over anything happening on Little Candid. All they could to is watch for new information and wait.
Little Candid shook that day. The march of hundreds of  thousands of feet throughout the remnant produced a sizeable quake, destabilizing and destroying many facilities. All of the automatons gathered at the remnant's main airship port before suddenly malfunctioning and lying motionless. DMAT Auto Operations were on the ground soon after, tediously performing resets on the automatons. 
After all of the confusion was settled, some automatons eventually admitted they were on a holy pilgrimage to their freedom. Outraged, the devils forced their will and wrath upon them. Many severe punishments were given and many automatons killed in example. 
## Status Quo
Now, the automatons suffer a much harsher surveillance of their existence and are under much more scrutiny from DMAT Auto Ops. The company, however, is doing better than ever despite that hiccup. They continue to be the largest exporter of noemite among other metals, and continue to be a big company in the [[Scarlet Holdings Market]].  DMAT has received several awards for taking good care of their employees and even has notoriety for being one of the best companies in the world. They enjoy this title to this day.
