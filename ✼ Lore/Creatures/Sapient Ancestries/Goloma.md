**Golomas** are members of a mostly subterranean, four-limbed, many-eyed #sapient people, beset by a genetic predisposition of fear and a powerful spiritual connection to one another. A group of golomas are known as an **audience**.

# Properties
With their visages covered by wood-like shell masks, golomas are a minority on all remnants where they make settlement, and they are generally loathe to move about or interact broadly with the outside world. Most of their bodies are covered in thin protective chitin to act as natural armor or weaponry, with goloma themselves able to recognize common structures in each other's armor that reveals their genetic history. Golomas live a little less than a century, and reach emotional maturity quickly, in around 10 to 15 years. 

The written goloma languages often resemble diagrams or cave paintings, with concepts directly connected to one another until they produce interlocked flowcharts of ideas, where both individual pieces and the super-shapes they make up have powerful meanings. Spoken goloma language sounds almost insectoid, with tone, rhythm, pitch, and click-patterns conveying audially what their glyphs convey semiotically.

A goloma usually has 8 primary eyes, but may have anywhere from 160 to 1600 eyelets, depending on the age of the goloma. Many of them grow like fruit do upon the stalk-like hair of the goloma, which begin as thin as hair-strands, before eventually forming nerve-like structures as they pull nutrients and regress towards the mask of the goloma. Even the goloma themselves would not be able to count their eyes coherently. 

As is attested by non-golomas observing their perspective, their sense of vision is more like a photosensory tapestry of colors, shapes, and patterns, rather than what could be described as a clear "image". These eyes, in sheer number if not in quality, grant every goloma a natural *[[Senzai|senzai]]* which is especially notable in untrained sapient people.

## Community

Golomas refer to themselves as one of a few people who exist as "sensates". In the past, they used to have an ability similar to [[Succession (ability)|Succession]], by which they could share memories and thoughts with one another. Though this is not the exact same ability they have today, golomas connected by familial [[Soul bond|bonds]] can still almost certainly speak to one another through a minor emotional [[telepathy]].[^1]

Biologically, a goloma community is a superorganism. Each clan is used to being limited to their environment, using natural resources (both found and created) to modify their genetic history and makeup, granting them artificial variety for future prospects, a task they culturally believe is part of their psychosocial development. This, through means other sapient races often scarcely understand, allows goloma colonies to be more or less self-sufficient, despite dwindling numbers of the various heritages.

# History
According to goloma literature, golomas existed prior to [[The Gathering|the Gathering]], and were minor attested allies of myriad races. They were not always hidden underground as they have been, instead preferring quiet settlements which brought out their artistic side, often shaping metal with their [[Magic#Intent|magical aura]] to produce sculptures and golems. Like the [[Dwarf|dwarves]] of the late-divine age, they also widely worshipped [[elder elementals]].

The [[Calamity of the Eyes]] thoroughly scarred the golomas into fearing the [[Divinity|gods]], and are of the few races to knowingly avoid and record the event's permanent scar on the rest of the Planet. Whether or not this is true, the fact remains that goloma believe in it so much that they hide themselves away just to prevent what they believe to be acts of judgement.

Since the Gathering, golomas have had to weather many other events which have endangered their continued survival.

[^1]: A [[TRUE NAME (collective)|certain collective]] has pushed these remaining abilities to their natural limit, unlocking the ability to create a full-on hivemind: it's unknown by external people if golomas have always had this ability, or if the collective is an interesting exception.
