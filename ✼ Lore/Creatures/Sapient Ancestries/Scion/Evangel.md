**Evangels** (*eve-angel*) were a #sapient [[scion|scion]] ancestry who held a caste higher than [[Human|humans]] during the time of the [[Carapa Republic]]. A common ancestor of modern-day [[aasimar]], they were known for their black wings and unnatural endurance, as well as their sixth sense known as "[[Succession (ability)|Succession]]". Evangels did not have much of a sense of gender.

Evangels could breathe water and air, and seemed to have an interminable lifespan.

Their tenacity enabled them to make many early strides in magic, specifically in the development of golemancy and [[marmarancy]].

Evangels were known to hold power in [[Dawndust]] and [[High Sacred]]. It is said that dead evangel lines eventually formed psychic stagnancies called [[quori]], leading to the siring of [[kalashtar]], who possess similar succession abilities.
