The **amulet of seven-hearted death** is an enchanted amulet.

Created by a native civilization of the [[Colossal Ocean]] from a unique effect of the [[Whirlpool of Souls]], this piece of jewelry was forged from a deposit of saturated red [[Mana]], which acts as a rare binding component in enchantment. The amulet was created in the image of a ruby skull, in reverence of an ancient [[Death]] entity not known extensively of outside of their culture, named [[Macha]], called "Seven-Hearted Death". 

This is owned by [[Even Baxly]].
