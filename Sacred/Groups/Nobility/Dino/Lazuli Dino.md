Sovereign **Lazuli Mi Invict Dino**, born **Linnaeus** and nicknamed "**Linnie**", is the sovereign ruler of the [[Kingdom of Sacred|Kingdom of Sacred]]. Child to [[Tyranno Re Ursus]] and [[Velocis Dino]], as a young adult, they and their [[dragonic curse]] were the subject of concern in the [[Dragonic War]]. Following that harrowing experience, they came out as non-binary and took their present name.

A [[Human|human]] [[aasimar|aasimar]], Lazuli fashions themself a [[Benediction|paladin]] as his mother was, although they dedicates themself to the power of devotion (or love as they put it) rather than their mother's oath to the ancients. They wield the mighty [[Dinofang]].

# History
## Early life
Lazuli was born in [[Drastic]] on the Seventeen to Kalends of Ersta, [[1229 PT]]. Their birth name, **Linnaeus**, was given in honor of long-standing royal advisor [[Linnean Burgitsk]].

Secretly, Lazuli bore the [[Dragonic Curse]], which was detected prior to his birth. [[Ildy]], [[Eidolon]] of [[Drastic]], had sworn to assist him as a companion to suppress the curse from birth. 

Linnie was born after [[Critical Hit]] came to prominence — after the ban was repealed and when the [[Age of Adventurers]] had begun in earnest. He was, from a very early age, inquisitive and cunning, never taking unknowns to be answers. Even to recent times, he was a notorious note keeper, always being caught jotting something down or taking some plant to sketch it or press it later. He would also never be caught alone, always wanting to share journeys with others. 

While he could never rid himself of Ildy, who’d been appointed at his side to oversee him from birth, he also sought counsel and aid from his own friends, notable among their number [[Varri Raptra]], [[Aster Claudius]], and, of course, the paladin dragoon-in-training [[Lylian Burgitsk]].

However, all cures attempted seemed to fail, including an attempt where [[Werwin Krara]] was requested to the task, but was unable to, forcing his memory to be [[Modify memory|modified]]. 

## [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]]
In [[1250 PT]], Linnie eventually turned to [[Ikabod Caruso]] for aid, an act which both created the [[Visitant|visitants]] of his [[soul]] and united the [[S4]], and eventually led to his curing. He approached Stage 4 of the curse when Ildy was slain and his affliction was revealed audaciously [[Red Spark|during the Summit]], an event which kicked off the [[Dragonic War]]. 

He was kidnapped, spending the following months within the clutches of the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], taken to the [[Nail of Nortia]] in [[New Orc City]]. After succumbing to his curse and losing his protector, his current status was unknown for a long time, only sighted in truth just after the [[Blackflame]] was transferred to its vessel in the [[Wings of the End]].

However, during [[Zero Day]], the spirit of Arahabaki which had awakened within him was defeated, and in doing so the curse of that dragon had lifted from his body and spirit. Having been rescued, he returned to Sacred aboard the *[[Full Velocity]]* with newfound wings.

## Post-Zero Day
Following their rescue, the only company Linnie seemed to keep consistently was [[Star of the North]], an adventurer with whom had fostered a mutual interest.

Three months after Zero Day, a deeply-changed and reflective Lazuli invited the remaining S4 over to a quiet part of the castle [[Linnie's words of thanks|for a pie and words of gratitude]], as well as speaking more freely about questioning their gender in general.
