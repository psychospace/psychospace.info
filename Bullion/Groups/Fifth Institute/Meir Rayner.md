Special Adjunct **Meir Rayner**, also known as "Karver", is a [[kobold]] ally and armorer for the [[Fifth Institute]], operating out of the [[Playground Facility]] in south [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Winifreyad]]. Not much is known about them by the general public, aside from their body of work.

In spite of difficulties in their childhood related to strange [[antimagic]] properties their body seems to naturally exhibit, Rayner has dedicated themself to being of use. To that end, Rayner has trained to become an [[Enchantment|enchanter]]-armorer for most of the [[Songbird|songbirds]] and [[Broadcaster|Broadcasters]] employed by the Fifth, as his body's abilities enable him to baffle even the most stalwart of Codecs, enabling others to live more comfortably.

Among those benefitted by his counter-obeyance to [[logic]], [[Sanza Rayo]], [[Coro Oxtail]], and [[Al Bordeaux]] were granted armors befitting their abilities, and new defensive technology continues to be constructed by them to this day.
