On the Ides of Vire, [[1249 PT]], a **mass-resurrection** occurred, apparently as a result of [[The Pitcher|the Pitcher]]. Over one-hundred people from across [[Bullion]] who had died since the Ides of Vire, [[1248 PT]], suddenly returned to life without explanation. It was apparently as a result of the [[Confluence|conflux]] between positive and negative energy.

These revived people awoke in caves nearby their points of death or burial, each with visions of a pallid figure stepping away from them, saying "*Say, friend. I've had my fun. This time, you walk free.*"

This included:
* [[Melia Tonin]], who had passed away when *[[Alexander (airship)|the Alexander]]* crashed while she was aboard.
* [[Miguel Jaeger]], who had died from an arrow wound in the back of the head.
* [[TRUE NAME (12-242)|12-242]] of [[TRUE NAME (collective)|TRUE NAME]], who had died at the hands of a cave monster.
* [[Aingeru Ariessus]], who had died after falling a significant distance during a performance at the [[Rainy Loch Theater]].
* [[Silver (XI)|Silver]], who had been ensnared inside an unreal space.

At the same time, the [[Base (XI)|Bases]] emerged: one of which was in [[Estelis Ranch]].
