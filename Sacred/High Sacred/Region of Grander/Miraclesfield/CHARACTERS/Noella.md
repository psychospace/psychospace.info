A [[Illithid|mind flayer]] who has made her humble home in a mountainside nearby [[Miraclesfield]], threatening those who encroach while simultaneously creating a mythical vibe about herself. In her heart of hearts, she is a kind person, originally whatever the equivalent of a Illithid conscientious objector would be.

She adopted [[Medu]] from a young age and taught her how to cast magic and hunt for herself. She has also sometimes adopted (mostly illicitly) other orphans from the street to similar effect.

Her current brood includes Nite, a bullheaded dramatic, and Pony, a centaur kid.

She raised a [[Displacer]] beast from a child, and when that beast had its own kit, later named [[Ann]], she gave it to her progeny, Medu.
