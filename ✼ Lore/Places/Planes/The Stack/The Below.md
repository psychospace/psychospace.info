**The Below** is the [[Shindani]] term given to the layer of [[The Heavens]] beyond the [[Scarlet Skies]], the one to which all [[Gravity]] magic is bound. Acting as the axiomatic [[Elemental energy|elemental]] [[Plane#Realm|plane]] of earth, it is the "true" surface of [[The Planet]], home to many odd things.

A myth says that what the Below is today was originally a construction by a [[First Magicians|First Magician]] known as [[Trayan]], who constructed it as a *magnum opus* called the [[Tower Machine]], an artificial super-[[Remnant]] which could harvest and utilize the energy of the core of the planet.
