### 2-19-1251
[[Shohei Integra]] reintroduces himself to the S4. That night, Kessah dreams of Hosuseri.[^63]

### 2-20-1251
[[Serena Nortia]] reveals herself to the S4[^63] and to the [[Kingdom of Sacred]][^64]. The combined forces of the party and Ikabod Caruso embark into [[Stygian]] for the [[Vault of Foreknowledge]], uncovering the truth of [[Arahabaki]]'s existence thanks to the reawakened [[Golorr]][^65]. After fighting off the Warden of Stygian[^66], the party traveled into the [[Vault of Foretelling]], bursting the lock and reawakening the sunken [[Aet'Caldwyn]]. Using the *[[Kymodokê]]*, and retrieving a suitable vessel in the form of [[Wings of the End]], the party set out for their new destination without further delay[^67].

### 2-21-1251
The party touches down on Aet'Caldwyn, meeting [[Lucid Sky]]. Using [[L'ipotesi|the slingshot]], the party enters the [[Cathedral of the Womb]] and retrieves the [[Invertebra]] from [[SUEANNIL]][^68]. With it in hand, the sky began to darken as the Conspiracy ambushed the party. The sudden threat caused Lucid Sky and [[Coursing Stream]] to malfunction[^69], though the party were able to knock them into sense again. Getting back aboard the *Kymodokê*, the party were further attacked by Hazel Sobol. Serena talks her down, and she reveals that she was commanded by [[Illarion Parasom]][^70] . The party returns to Drastic successfully, in part thanks to the unveiling of the SRF [[Full Velocity]][^71]. Most of the rest of the night is spent preparing the various groups of allies for the mission to Nortia.
