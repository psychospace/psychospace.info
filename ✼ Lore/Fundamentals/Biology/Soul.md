A **soul** is an ethereal, core part of a creature. It grants a creature its personhood and its agency in the world around it. It is bound to a [[Body|body]] by the [[Silver cord|silver cord]].

In sapient creatures, its soul is also its personality, and its ability to empathize and sympathize with others, creating [[Soul bond|soul bonds]]. It interfaces with [[Psychospace|psychospace]], more specifically. When a soul is ripped from the body, the creature [[Death|dies]]. 

A soul is made primarily of [[Vitality energy|positive energy]] and extremely potent [[Echo|echoes]]. These elements are held together by a form of self-[[Gravity|gravitational]] soul bond.

All souls are said to find their terminus in [[Unwri]], becoming [[Petitioner|petitioners]], eventually to be recycled and reborn in the plane of [[Mana (plane)|Mana]]. Ersatz souls, such as [[Creature#Whatsit|whatsits]], [[Quasidragon|quasidragons]], and [[eidolon]] souls, resemble the genuine article, but importantly have the distinction of being irretrievable if lost.

Unbound souls form a sort of "survival" instinct that drives them to drink up the purity of [[Vibe]] wherever it is plentiful in order to become stronger, also killing their allies. These are known generally under the name ***Psychonyms***, Words, or "lost souls". The precise circumstances that causes a soul to die in this way are unknown, but are largely attested to be the consequence of worthless, impoverished, horrific, incredibly impactful, or dishonored deaths.
  
In any specific case though, these souls gather where there is emotion and Vibe to be sapped from. The most powerful of these spirits often attract attention from [[Kibangan]], from which psychospace originates, and may receive the touch of certain entities, creating a [[Quori]].
