![[âŽ‹ 2FPG]]
A strange criminal faction known only as "**Tide of the Old Bridge**", or the **Tide of Zubizarreta**^[[[Shindani]]: *zoo-BEE-ZAH-reh-tah*] has cropped up in the past three years. 

They are the most wanted criminals in all of [[Bullion]] (as of [[1285 PT]]), comprised of the anonymous [[Abiath]], the knight known as the [[Thousand Rider]], and an unknown number of compeers, though they appear to be allied with the [[Geladoe cartel]].

They apparently hunt down [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]] for their power, and have been using them to create abominations that threaten various factions in the [[Aed & Maed]].
