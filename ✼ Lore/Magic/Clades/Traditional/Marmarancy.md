Named for [[St. Maramara]] of [[Pinwheel]], who brought the study to [[Dawndust]], **marmarancy** deals with the division and preservation of [[Soul|souls]] or beings in distinctly "other" forms. Naturally, it deals with [[Soulstone|soulstones]]. 

Its development led to the creation of things like [[Lifeblinding]], as well as the **[[Golorr]] Stone** and the **[[Heart container]]**.

The ancient term for what modern scholars now loosely identify as a branch of [[enchantment]] and [[Necromancy]], though it does not identify a singular sect of magic.
