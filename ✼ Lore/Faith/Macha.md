**Macha, Seven-Hearted Death** was an ancient [[Avatar of Death]] who was widely worshipped in the [[Colossal Ocean]].

[[Even Baxly]], as a child, discovered a book of their teachings, and later discovered a [[Amulet of Seven-Hearted Death|relic]] of theirs.

# Teachings
During Macha's time as the Avatar of Death, being a death cultist meant pursuing esoteric wisdom to have a true appreciation for life and understanding its place in existence, how death and entropy affects all things. It was a philosophy of loving life more than it was a group dedicated to worshiping a being of great power.

Members of the philosophy were encouraged to take up spiritual journeys to observe the lives, and deaths, of all manner of things. From the humble farmer and his crops, to kings and their kingdoms, and even the divine were to be chronicled in order to appreciate and understand the value of life and how it derives from our inevitable deaths. Uncommonly these journeys would involve enlisting in an army, for there is no better place to find such horrific and violent death on an absurd scale, and despite its weight; its pain must be known and felt within the cult.

Macha was considered to be a â€˜gentle' Avatar.
