The **Arkwright Improvement Company**, often shortened to **ImCo**, is a major industrial subsidiary of [[Lainese Heavy Industries]], owned and operated by its primary stockholders in the noble [[House Arkwright]]. Headquartered in [[Castellan's Junction]], as of [[1285 PT]], it has been operated by [[Narayan Arkwright]] for around ten years, and is largely considered the northeastern arm of the LHI.

Throughout the remnant of [[Bullion]] today, opinions on ImCo remain heavily varied. The company's efforts assisted in Bullion's recovery after the [[Great Hurricane]], and in the time since have worked to modernize the remnant, bringing many of its [[Dust tunnel|dust networks]] online. However, failures in their past have caused other sectors, especially poor or struggling ones, to suffer or languish.

# History
The Improvement Company, or simply "**ImCo**", was a project founded in [[1251 PT]], in the wake of the [[The Shibboleth|Shibboleth]]'s desire to recover from the [[Great Hurricane]]. One of the most expensive efforts of that relief effort, the company employed many [[Blue Cinder Militia|militiamen]] and carpenters and organized much of the cleanup, rebuilding and recovery after the hurricane. 

In the interim of [[1255 PT]], in an effort to speed up the process of restoration, the Improvement Company was partly-privatized, and was renamed to the Arkwright Improvement Company. The company's efforts and their efficacy was occasionally mottled by bureaucracy, incompetence, and cost-saving measures, and many individual projects ended up implemented in half-measures or sidelined. 

After a measure passed resulting in increased funding, in an attempt to curb these negative perceptions, the Arkwright Improvement Company was reincorporated as a subsidiary of LHI. This was seen as something of an effort of greed on the part of House Arkwright, and as a result, in the Shibboleth elections for [[Lord President]] in [[1260 PT]], House Arkwright lost  many citizens' favor due to perceived wasting of the remnant's resources.
