The many **Institutes of [[Bullion]]** serve a long tradition of fostering knowledge in her populace, something which probably began in [[Ith'Paraan]]'s time.

There are five Institutes:
- *The [[First Institute]], which burned down in [[Arnecca]]*
- The [[Second Institute]], the **Ponderosa-Sommers University of the Ithika Valley** in [[Eleyda]]
- The [[Third Institute]], the **Owo'i Towers of Wisdom**
- *The [[Fourth Institute]], which was destroyed during the [[Bullion Civil War]]*
- The [[Fifth Institute]], the **Manteian Institutional Conservatory of [[Karyos]]**
