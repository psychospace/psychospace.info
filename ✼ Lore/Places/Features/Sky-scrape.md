![[⎋ 2FPG]]
The **sky-scrape** is a [[Rune|rune]] over [[The Planet|the Planet]], resembling a crack or scratch upon the [[Dark Sea]] in the shape of the [[Crest of Conception]].

It emits white light at night, though it is visible at all hours of the [[Starfall|day]] when the [[Cloudscape|clouds]] are clear. It was created during [[Zero Day]] in [[1251 PT]], and many believe its thrumming energy is what brought about [[New Magic|new magic]].

# Creation

"Etched" by Contessa [[Scarla Nitrum]], using the power of the completed [[Blackflame|blackflame]] to conjoin the moons, the resultant destruction opened a tear in the Dark Sea. Nitrum claimed to use the sky-scrape to contact the forces that had placed her there, and at the same time to pause reality to await their response and subsequent appraisal. 

When the [[Tzitzimitl|tzitzimitl]] perished at the hands of the [[S4]], all the energy that had built up in the rune threatened to cause a [[The Sheer#Wildcat destabilization|wildcat destabilization]], poised to create a massive [[Ghost storm|ghost storm]] that would destroy the whole of [[The Heavens]] — effectively causing a [[TPK]]. 

Only the united power of the S4 together were able to condense the built-up force and dissipate it into [[Out There|the Out There]], leaving the rune behind in the night sky. In the process, an [[Omen|Omen]] arrived, named [[Emygdia]].

# Effects
The rune originally demonstrated an immense power to connect vast points in space, similar to a macroscale [[Rune|runic]] gun, partly by leveraging and consuming the energy of the [[Elseworld|Elseworld]].

Following its pacification by the S4, the rune's present effects are unprecedented and unknown, though it remains dormant. The rune occasionally appears to reactivate miscellaneous objects, or causes magic to locationally go haywire. 

Many believe it is the source of new magic.
