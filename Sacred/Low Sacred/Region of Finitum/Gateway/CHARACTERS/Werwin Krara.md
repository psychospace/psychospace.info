Once a student of **[[Succotash]]** in [[Drastic]], Werwin the [[halfling]] now acts as the head mage and one of the tacticians at [[Gateway]]. Pioneer of the *tiny hut* spell, as inspired by the landscape and scenarios in and around Gateway.

Werwin takes a unique approach to spell creation and experimentation, preferring to first paint the effects of spells and then tracing along the texture of the paint in his works: using the indentations and scratches of his utensils to surmise the possible arcane equations that might lead to such an effect.

This short bespectabled owl-like man was once Succotash's scribe and attendant. While acting under his tutelage, he helped craft the [[Broom of stars]] as well as a number of other fiery items before deciding that maybe the second time he burnt down a study should be the last time he burns down a study.



Even still, he keeps one of his own creations, a [floating lamp]{.underline} named Jincin, with him at most work hours.
