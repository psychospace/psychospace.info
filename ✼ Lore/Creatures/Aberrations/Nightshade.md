A **nightshade** or **darvakka** ("Bleak Sky" in [[Shadowtongue]]) is a kind of [[elseworld|else]]-[[aberration]], apparently borne of pure entropy. They are truly terrifying forces of destruction within the elseworld, loosely regarded as harrowing legends outside of it. 

Due to their destructive nature, information on their origin is scarce, but kayal and transworld philosophers both hypothesize they may have come from [[necrospace]] or else-[[Kibangan]].

# Properties

Widely accepted is that nightshades are manifestations of [[void energy]], [[undead]] entities that were never truly alive to begin with, which bring about [[death]] by their mere activity. The only sense of self they seem to possess is an intense hatred for [[vitality energy]] and anything alive: they are antithetical to life, drawn to it, incensed to destroy it. 

[[Soul|Souls]] claimed by the attacks of a nightshade can apparently never be recollected or [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]], viciously severing the core [[Soul bond|bond]] which defines the soul's selfhood. 

The mortality of nightshades is unknown. In the primary worldline, they "pass" similar to weather systems, but it is unknown by what mechanic this occurs. Within the elseworld, though some have apparently faded permanently, many still manifest and attack largely without recourse. 

According to kayal sources, the only thing that has ensured long-term survival against darvakkas is [[Reality-Bending|changing reality]] around it so it is misdirected.

## Physicality

The assumed physical form of nightshades are massive, ill-formed animalistic shapes constructed of pure shadow -- the medium which makes this shape up like a murky black dust cloud or [[weather|storm]] system. These shapes do not have a any known limit on their biology, other than their apparent mass: nightshades have been seen as tremendously tall six- or eight-limbed humanoid shapes, eighty-legged distorted dogs or crabs, fractal-like protoplasms, and others.

Some posit this is just a projected avatar used as a tool or weapon, and that their true form is either undetectable or implacable. Regardless of what shape they take, it is widely believed that nightshades cannot be reasoned with in any capacity. 


## Goals
Throughout both worldlines, no reason has been discerned for the indiscriminate bedlam spread by the nightshades. 

Kayal culture in the years that have followed 616 E-PT have widely viewed nightshades as genuine arbiters of the apocalypse, sent to stomp on what is left of the divinity's creations. 

The shadow of [[Uforia]] in [[Else-Orkrengrad]] has hypothesized their intentions as "omnicidal, in the ontologic sense". She believes their desire is to destroy the existence of life forwards and backwards -- to render all creations of life and immortality unrecoverable -- as life was one of the few things which survived the TPK wholesale. 

On what authority the nightshades operate, if not their own, is remains unknown. 
# Influence
## Within the Alternate [[Worldline]]
After the [[TPK]] ravaged the elseworld in [[616 E-PT|616 E-PT]], their psychospace was warped into the [[Light (property)|darkness]]-preferential [[necrospace]]. Nightshades first descended during this time, furthering the apocalypse by enacting mass slaughter upon what remained. They targeted dense populations first, ensuring as many [[Soul|souls]] were lost to entropy as possible.

The elseworld remains in constant danger from nightshades, whose presence in the plane has only grown. Many creatures and forces threaten the kayals, but the threat of drawing a nightshade's attention hangs over all else-societies, forcing most kayals into nomadism and/or deep into hiding.



As else-socieities dwindle and combine for survival, attacks from nightshades become ever unpredictable and all the more devastating. Despite the remnants crashing down to the planet, it is the influence of untenable destructive forces like darvakkas that have "reinvented" the concept of unsafe "[[Skysea|oceans]]" of influence.


## Within the Primary Worldline
Nightshades are not known to exist in the [[Antic Sea]] proper. According to accepted transworld philosophy, the filter on the light of [[Cien]], created by the shadow of [[psychospace]], prevents them from forming: and that when this "filter" was removed in the sister-world, these entities rapidly took root. 

Even so, soothsayers claim nightshades watch hungrily from the elseworld, waiting for a collapse state to annihilate Light on both sides of the "coin". Were this to occur, nightshades would be able to transcend their point of origin to continue their entropic crusade upon a new world.

Nightshades can be temporarily [[summoner|summoned]] (typically by powerful [[Necromancy|necromancers]]) onto the planet; although they are powerful enough to resist the binding call of a summoning spell, it is typical for a nightshade to submit to the spell in order to spread entropy and death beyond their plane.
