In arcane terminology, **benediction** is a [[Magic|magical]] study reliant partly on [[divinity|faith]], which concerns itself with the power gained from dedication to a particular oath, ideal, or person by [[Soul bond|bonding]] oneself wholeheartedly to it. The common term for a user or student of benediction is **paladin**.

Due to the variety of oaths through which one can gain benedictive power, benediction is rarely studied on the broad terms.
