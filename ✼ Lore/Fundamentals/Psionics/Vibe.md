**Vibe** is a [[Chaos|chaotic]] ethereal fluid which is the "[[air]]" of [[psychospace]]. Vibe absorbs willpower and intent from nearby [[Plane#realm|physical space]], and then takes on the properties of that willpower, changing itself, a property called [[Light (property)|Light]].

A measurable "ripple" in Vibe produces an [[off-wave]], the patterns of which can form [[Psinomenon|psinomenons]] and [[confluence|confluences]]. Vibe, like air, can support life if breathed.

# Properties
![[Off-wave#^c5b775]]


Vibe's nature is why [[Figment|figments]] generally exist in an accord with the area they spawn in, such as [[Eidolon|eidolons]] affecting (and being affected by) changes in the community they were born into.

When Vibe takes on properties from the surrounding environment, it changes its nature, and thus the effects that psychospace has on the outside world. 

For example, an extremely angry group of people would cause the ambient emotional "temperature" of Vibe to greatly increase, which might cause animals or other people to grow restless in the vicinity.

# Use
Vibe is channeled to cast [[magic]], and can be converted into physical forms (such as [[lux]] or [[mana]]) for other uses, such as powering machines. It is also the general source of sustenance required for [[figment|figments]].

Vibe is an unusual resource, in that it cannot be removed from psychospace without changing form, nor can its properties be directly manipulated by [[Creature|creatures]]. This is because since a [[soul]] is typically individualized, their wills are naturally limited in influence without another source of power, such as [[illusion]] magic.
