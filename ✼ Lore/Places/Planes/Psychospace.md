**Psychospace** (/saɪ̯.koʊ̯.speɪs/ <small><i>sy-KOH-spayse</i></small>) is a [[Plane#Sphere|sphere]] of existence which defines [[The Heavens|the Heavens]]. It parallels and exists alongside the [[Plane#Realm|physical world]], and is affected by the thoughts and ideas of [[Soul|souls]]. 

The adjective form is _psychospacial_ (_sy-KOH-SPAY-shul_). Study of psychospace is known as [[psionics]].

From psychospace, driven by [[Logic]], all [[Magic]] is given power, and all souls are granted agency. The plane is the three-dimensional shadow of the fourth-dimensional [[Kibangan]], as cast by the star [[Cien]]: specifically, over [[The Planet|the Planet]], though it technically may be accessed throughout the [[Antic Sea]]. 

Instead of [[air]], psychospace is comprised of [[Vibe]], which has a number of properties, predominant among them is the effect created by other souls, thus creating [[Light (property)|Light and Dark]].  Psychospace experiences common patterns of energy referred to as as [[Off-wave|off-waves]], measurable in ways similar to wind. Wherever multiple off-tides tend to meet is known as a [[Confluence]].

Were it to vanish, a [[TPK]] would occur.

Psychospace borders so closely on the Heavens, through its all-encompassing nature, that its connection is shaky enough to sometimes perceive naturally. The ability for creatures in the physical world to perceive psychospace is known as _[[Senzai]]_. Those borne from psychospace are called [[Figment|figments]].
