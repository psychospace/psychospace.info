The **Carapa Republic** was a government controlled by tribes of [[Evangel|evangels]] who ruled over [[High Sacred]]. Its name is an [[Oa'Rovi]] word which roughly means "the tenets of people".

It was described in its time as a grandiose land, founded by relatives of the inhabitants of [[Mount Celestia]], or as it was known in the time, Blank Castle ([[Celestial language|Celestial]]: *Castel del'Intoso*). They referred to [[angel|angels]] as *Alle Presenza*, the Afore People.

They only strongly controlled [[High Sacred]], though ruins of theirs which exist in [[Low Sacred]] are attributed to [[Unitor|Unitors]]. The distinction between High and Low Sacred was named by them as Carapa and Low Carapa.

The Republic fell in [[746 PT]] when it was conquered by the [[Kingdom of Sacred]].


# Dios Evangel
The *Dios Evangel* were those who presided over the Carapa Republic, which had achieved effectively infinite life through repeated [[Succession (ability)|succession]], leading to many hundreds of years passing without a sign of age. The Carapa Republic flew a brilliant violet flag with a red emblem, distinctive amongst relics as the Carapas seemed to have a strong national identity.
