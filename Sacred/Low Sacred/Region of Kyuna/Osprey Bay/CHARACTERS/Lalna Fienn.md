High [[Elf]], head priestess of the [[School of Menders]].

Lalna was the one to recognize [[Eldral Levin]]'s aspirations, and thus told him the myth of the [[Aurelia fruit|Aurelia Tree]] as a sort of promise that he could leave to make some good happen in the world. Telling him this myth was sort of an implication as to how she rose to become head priestess long ago.
