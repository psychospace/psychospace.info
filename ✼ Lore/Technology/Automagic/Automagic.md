**Automagic** is a study of [[magic]] focusing on automation and electrification. It typically describes automating aspects of magical research or development such as through remotely transporting [[Psychic code|code]] or [[Echo|data]] from one place to another. 

Specific subfields include communication, electrification, [[figment]] creation, testing, and [[enchantment]], to name a few. It is a field which allows non-casters to regularly interact with and benefit from magical research.

The study of automagic machines has evolved greatly over the years, but currently stands in an interstitial era between [[lux]] and [[verlan]].
