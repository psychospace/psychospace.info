[[Ridd of Chained-Earth|Ridd]]'s legendary weapon, a long, pale white *odachi* blade with little pale red and blue rocks encircling where the hilt is.

It is functionally identical to a *greater silver sword*, but acts also as Ridd's pact weapon.

The Sword of Estrangement is further capable of severing certain contacts one has with planes beyond them. As an action while wielding the blade, Ridd can dispel any scrying orb within 20 feet of him (requiring the use of see invisibility, naturally).
