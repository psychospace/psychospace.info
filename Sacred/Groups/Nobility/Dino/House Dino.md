**House Dino** is a noble house, the royal house of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] for many generations, since the fall of the reign of the Falknjir line. They originated with the Paraves line, who took up the mantle of ruler when eliminating the [[Basil Falknjir|first]] to succumb to the [[dragonic curse]], after which the curse's ambitions chased them instead.

Their [[house words]] are often shortened to simply “*Repent and Set Fire*.” Many grave markers throughout Sacred are marked *R+SF* in honor of this.

The [[swordschool]] of House Dino is given the traditional name "**revenger**" or "**god-hunter**." Often used by Sacred [[buster|busters]], revenging is characterized broadly as ruthless, aiming to attack in ways which disallow any chance of surrender. This facet originated with both the Falknjir and Paraves swordschools, but it was refined by the repeated necessity to be prepared to eliminate (as quickly as could be managed) [[dragonic whillo|whillos]] at any time. ^41b979

The existence of certain moves within the curricula of revenging, such as attacks which viciously [clip the wings](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_clipping) of humanoid targets, is key to the understanding that this was the fighting style used by [[Plesio Falknjir]] against the [[Carapa Republic]] (as is accurate to the [[⎊ Golorr Bares All#^dbe070|memory of Golorr]]). The style's pinnacle weapon, [[Dinofang]], was forged long after this, but the fighting style has remained [[⎊ Hazel's Arrival#^d6d23f|noticeably similar]] throughout the ages.

The art of revenging places a great emphasis on weight, momentum, and stamina, and has a particular focus on toppling larger opponents. Especially compared to other swordschools, it is considered something of a inhuman and brash fighting strategy, better for executions than for combat. Indeed, the sons and daughters of [[House Vendleberg]] also uses the swordschool of the Dino family.
