***Wish*** is a legendary [[Spell|spell]] and [[ritual|ritual]] of [[Evocation|Evocation]], commonly referred to as the [[Arcane complexity|most powerful]] spell a mortal can learn and cast. It is in many ways descriptive to call it the "ultimate" magic, as it acts as essentially ad-hoc access into the [[Divine Equation]], something for most that requires decades to learn. 

# History

The history of wish's influence dates back to the enigmatic [[First Magicians]]. As reality bent to the Magicians' wills, the [[Divinity|divine]] gained more and more tangible influence and power, as though wish brought definition and reach to the gods' [[domain|domains]]. 

In ~500,000 BPT, the cosmological event described as “[[The Gathering]]” took place. The outcome of this era reduced the magic power of [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]] by uncountable magnitudes, leading to a paradigm shift that made such direct access to the Equation almost infinitely more difficult than it had been to the First Magicians. 

Less than fifty humanoid casters since are believed to have ever had access to this spell, although [[Genie|djinni]] royalty, predilected towards the spell, have been known to share their ability to cast this spell for their own ends.

In modern times, [[Eidolon|eidolons]], already connected to the Divine, possess a much weaker magic akin to wish known as “[[weaving]]”, which allows them to mimic spells they have seen before below a particular level of complexity.
