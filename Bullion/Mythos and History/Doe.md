**Doe** is the pseudonym of the mysterious [[Witchcraft|witch]] who, in [[1159 PT]], united the Geiger and Lara crime families of [[Bullion]] into the collective [[Geladoe cartel]]. Though their identity is not known to the general public and many myths have since spread, they are generally believed to be one of the [[Witch-King]]'s lieutenants, found in a small crater in [[Tarnation]] and raised as an orphan. 

Due to their pseudonymous nature, it is unknown what, if any, their present whereabouts are. Many say that since the Witch-King was captured in [[1194 PT]] that Doe was arrested as well, but no figure by that name was ever found in the wake of the raid on [[Thunder-Fork Temple]].
