**"Kaiser Nine"** is a pseudonymous [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Freyite]]-[[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacreder]] [[human]] and [[chirologist]], currently serving as a [[High Manteian]] kept by [[Isidor Sycamore]]. Also sometimes affectionately called "K9", Nine's ability as a [[Broadcaster]] has kept them in preferred interest by the [[Fifth Institute]].

Nine is the most recent High Manteian, joining the collective after garnering significant interest from Sycamore, its mentor, in [[1282 PT]].

# History

According to an interview by the [[Tonapoulis Gazette]], Kaiser was born in [[1266 PT]] and endured a difficult and estranged upbringing which possibly shattered it [[Worldline#Transcendence|across universes]], further necessitating its strange pseudonym^[which, it maintains to this day, is not its "true" name.]. His ontological condition was regarded as unstable by the native Sacred authorities, but was eventually treated and stabilized by [[Sanza Rayo#Codec Lamella|lamellan light]] therapy, taking the form of its present ability. To help further

Growing into a young adult, Nine always held an insatiable desire for knowledge and adventure, which brought it to overachieve in school(s). Nine is the only 'individual' in history to *simultaneously* enroll at the [[Second Institute|Second]], [[Third Institute|Third]] AND Fifth [[Institutes of Bullion]]. 

After its ability was discovered and all nine of itself were brought in and charged by the [[luminaria]] with insider trading^[An allegation widely believed to be true.], it was offered an alternative path by the Fifth Institute as a [[Reclamation (Bullion)|reclaimer]]. 

Nine and its ability would prove indispensable in research throughout the Institutes' work. As such, eventually it earned the renown to necessitate a greatening of their own role, and was raised to the level of High Manteian, left vacant after the refusal of the promotion of [[Vahan Viliami]].

# [[Codec]]: Me
Nine's [[Codec]], unhelpfully self-identified as "**Me**" and sometimes further known as "**Hydra**", exemplifies their strange state of existence. 

Though ill-understood by the public^[According to [[Sanza Rayo]], for Nine's own safeties.], the basic ability presented by "Me" is that Nine is able to "clone" itself, enabling it to interact with others of itself. 

These copies are each and all representative of Nine itself, and no one Nine serves as the “real” Nine. Each Nine shares sensation and long-term memory with its others, effectively having one brain. However, importantly short-term memory is not shared, and thus multiple Nines can hold a stable conversation.

Nine has experienced [[death]] before, and this ability has enabled them to persist throughout those deaths.
