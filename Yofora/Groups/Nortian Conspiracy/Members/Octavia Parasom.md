**Octavia Calliandra Parasom**, genderfluid [[kalashtar]] child of [[Illarion Parasom]], was a ringleader of the [[Heartknock]] along with [[Amanita Parasom|their sibling]].

Octavia was the first to discover the [[Visage of the Fortress]], and studied it for its anomalous properties. Like all of the Conspirators, Octavia wore the [[Cloak of Excelsio]].

# History
As a young child, [[Amanita Parasom]] at some point entered the [[elseworld]] very briefly. When Amy glimpsed the elseworld through a dream of the dark from her [[quori|quori]] guide, her nascent [[Echo|shadow]] took on a protective spirit, and split, becoming Octavia. ^ef2572

When they did so, Octavia actualized herself and "split" from Amanita, freeing itself and becoming Amy's twin sister, assuring her that she would never have to feel alone.

It was Octavia's connection to the elseworld that sparked [[Illarion Parasom]]'s concerns that the [[End Times]] would eventually be upon them.

## Ends
After the events of the War, Octavia had been taken captive by [[XO]] and the remnants of the conspiracy (led by [[Wren Doggabone|Wren]]) in an attempt to negotiate an escape. After using their [[Soul bond|bonds]] to create a [[portal]] to one another, Octavia was [[Burun massacre|rescued]] from [[Burun]] by Amanita, killing all of their captors. 

The two exiled themselves to the [[First City]] in an ill-advised attempt to rehabilitate. Their dual nature seemed to keep the plane from influencing them directly, and their crimes in reality needed them to see justice.

After about six months, a message was delivered to Serena which gave the twin's address in the City, as they were essentially giving themselves up. They were eventually recaptured by [[Arthur Graywell|Arthur]], after a short gunfight, and tried for their crimesÂ by the [[Order of Hope]]. 

Their lack of the [[mark of tears]], as they truly believed they were helping Serena, complicated their trial. However, the Heartknock and the twins had committed too many crimes against the planet and her people to be left alive, and were sentenced to [[death]] by [[Volk Vendleberg]].

Amanita was executed first, and before Octavia could be, her body and soul vanished into nonexistence whence it came: supposedly, her [[silver cord]] was severed in the same strike as Amy's, their bond indistinct from it. As Arthur would later postulate, Octavia being Amanita's shadow led to mutually assured destruction, and this was the last mercy the siblings were afforded: both of their souls set free at once.

Amanita and Octavia died in the same moment, aged 45. Some still speculate, without evidence, that Octavia is still out there.
