**Novalor** is a magic katana, once used by [[XO]]. 

This blade was forged in the [[Scarlet Skies]], crafted of bismuth-steel by a particularly eccentric [[Devil]] who wished to take over the [[Wild Blue Yonder]] by winning every duel he fought. When he was killed by a [[Wegbrechen|breakaway]], nobody remembered his name or his story. But because a breakaway has no use for weaponry, it only became part of its hoard, and passed to the ownership of XO when they slayed the monster in turn.

%%This weapon has a constant *zone of* truth (DC 15) emanating from it which affects everyone except its wielder. This is designed to throw opponents off balance, forcing them to fight with only what they have. In addition, if you wield it, you can cast *hunter's mark* from it without expending a spell slot.
