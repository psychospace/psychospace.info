An **undead** is a [[body|body]] or [[soul|soul]] which exists and continues moving in spite of the creature's [[Death|death]], usually through exploiting its *[[Fylgja|fylgja]]*. Undead span a vast array of complexity and power levels, from the simplistic but powerful skeletons to the defiantly powerful liches.

Undead are usually the product of [[Necromancy|necromancy]], which is in some cases considered the "study of undead", though this isn't exclusively the case. Some are generated by latent or intent [[Magic]] and have been known to possess much further intelligence than is possible through necromantic reanimation, at the cost of some abilities.

Once youâ€™re undead, your soul is *always* undead until it is rebirthed: it usually loses its natural ability to travel to [[Unwri]], unless its restored by [[Resurrection]] magic or manually retrieved by a [[Psychopomp]]. This has both good aspects and bad aspects.
