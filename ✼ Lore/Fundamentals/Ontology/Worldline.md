In [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]] studies, a "**worldline**" is the [[Epitome|epitome]] of the very [[The Heavens|Heavens]] themselves. A worldline describes the change of the world through [[time]] *and* space, rather than concerning the timeline of a singular piece of it. 

Sometimes, though rarely, the definition expands to include other planetoids, [[Manifold Seas]], or sometimes all of the [[universe]]. 

Someone who could [[time travel|travel through time]] could travel along the worldline through both time and space at once, effectively granting an extremely powerful [[teleportation]] ability.

The worldline described on this wiki is, without otherwise specifying, describing the events of the *primary worldline* (which hasn't [[End Times|ended]], yet, to my knowledge). **Alternate** worldlines are also described, such as [[Elseworld]].  ^a586f7

# Nature

Viewed from a top-down perspective, a worldline is called such because it does not, per se, describe a 1-dimensional structure, but an endless chain of interlocking states (known as [[Context|contexts]]) which work together and follow alongside one another to bring about an experience of reality.

All actions, natural laws, and [[Logic|logical]] continuations of cause-and-effect continuously permeate and alter the worldline on a scale too incredibly intricate to measure or quantify. Instead, [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturges]] often simply concern themselves with "bigger-picture" effects to the worldline, such as major [[Reality-Bending|reality-bends]], or tendencies of the worldline, the same fatal structures interpreted by [[Divination|diviners]].

# Beyond a worldline
Without a worldline, there would be nothing distinguishing this [[The Planet|Planet]] from the [[Out There|Out There]] that cradles it, creating [[Chartless Sea|chartless]] space. In other words, nothing which came from here would be able to perceive or continue as normal. A [[Collapse state|collapse state]] is the common term.

One cannot vacate or observe, externally, the worldline they were born to. However, potentiality and logic dictates that an infinitely-many worldlines exist as potential, 'parallel' futures. 

Typical logic, thusly, restricts potentiality to only what has occurred: in other words, only things that have already happened, and things which are happening, can dictate the future. 

## Transcendence

Despite this rigidity, some believe their home worldline might be transcended.

Through contact with a possibility-field, such as a [[Gift (witchcraft)|Gift]], your perspective might expand beyond the limits set by typical logic, viewing theoretically 'perpendicular' worldlines. However, this can cause [[altercation|dangerous side-effects]].

Incredibly rarely, if ever, have entities from [[the Heavens]] been able to travel to an alternate worldline, except [[elseworld]], as the cycle of souls through [[reincarnation]] keeps them anchored to the [[Divine Equation]]. 

During travels of [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] [[Void breaker|void breakers]], lore of theirs reported being subject to alternate "rules" and so alternate logic when traveling to different [[Manifold Seas|manifold seas]].

Certain entities, since the rise of [[new magic]], have been reportedly [[Collapse state#Ark effect|escapees]] of collapsed worldlines, though such worldlines have thus far gone unobserved by researchers.
