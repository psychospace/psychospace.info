Dr. **R. S. Langford**^[See [[#Etymology]].] is an entity of unknown makeup, but supreme psionic prowess, who distantly oversees and created [[Single-Brain Cell]]. 

<span class="glitch" data-text1="His" data-text2="Her">Their</span> ontology, mortality, or its true aim with forming the SBC is ultimately a mystery. Despite having created this group, an interview with "[[The Best]]" determined that though it oversees the Cell, the Cell continues to work for nobody but themselves.

In a public address in late [[1284 PT]], [[Sanza Rayo]] has instructed [[the Shibboleth]] that coming forward with any concrete knowledge of this entity would be rewarded: such a bounty has yet to be soundly claimed.
# Ontology
>[!quote|author] *Doc to Clover, unknown time: reported to authorities during an interrogation*
>"When you think on something long enough, and deep enough, some say everything sounds the same. It's more like, everything tends towards harmony. You think hard enough about this world of ours, sooner or later, you're gonna start *learnin*' about this world of ours. And the more you learn, the more you can control."

Despite this supposedly deep connection to a decently-storied group, information in any sphere about R. S. Langford is tantamount to intense speculation. As of present day in [[1285 PT]], they have never been physically located, pictured, directly named, or identified. 

Many people, including the Cell's membership, have mentioned meeting with or speaking to the Doc, and yet, never once can a meeting be proven to have physically taken place. The person attested to be closest connected to the being is [[Clover]], who claims to have been adopted and raised by Langford, and who possesses a similar ability (possibly a [[Sophist]]-like gift). 

Attempts by the [[Fifth Institute]] to contact an entity by this name, living or dead, have all failed, though it remains an open question that these attempts are thwarted by Langford’s purported luck, or if the being does not exist at all.

# Appearance
Continual attestations by the Cell and their predecessors assert that Langford is itself a person, or at least appears as one. They are occasionally depicted in [[Numberless Children|Nulk]] art, including art created by the Cell itself.

As they are described by those that have met them, Langford is a powerful magic caster of an indeterminately adult age. They are usually described as wearing simple clothes, though faintly glowing as though they are a comforting presence. Their hair is usually described as black, but can vary based on accounts. They speak in a gentle, friendly whisper so soft it is impossible to tell their gender. 

The appearance most often associated in relation to them depicts them with shoulder-length hair and a gaze that seems humble, distant, and almost cute from a certain perspective.

# History
The Doc, or an entity apparently resembling them, has been attested in various cultures for centuries, occasionally as a manifestation of the [[Accidental God]], sometimes as a cultic icon. In almost all cases, only a single record remains of its actions, and very little to describe it by. However, it appears to have taken a more direct role in the world during [[13th century PT]], and especially in [[Bullion]] around the epoch of [[Zero Day]].

Since so much of their history is shrouded, the earliest act that could be directly attributed to Langford would be Langford's protection of the children at the [[Lavas Hideaway]] and his corequisite association (though unknown) with the Fifth Institute's investigation into [[Omen|omens]].^[This was specifically discovered by the victims of the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]]].

In the years since [[Zero Day]], Langford's notability has risen significantly, especially due to its orchestration of SBC.  Whispers hold that Langford has no visual form, in some way is the reason [[The Signal]] exists in this universe, or that the entity simply doesn't exist "yet", whatever that entails. 

The Doc is attributed with having, through luck-manipulation from before their members' birth, assembled the SBC together. It is their ability which appears to have arranged events so that they would each be born with their abilities, and so they each would eventually meet. These events were sometimes outright benevolent, other times teaching someone a hard, moral lesson through punishment. 



# Abilities

Though certainly not a traditional [[Broadcaster]], R. S. Langford possesses unique qualities that could technically grant them a [[Codec]]. Specifically, the supreme luck they seem to carry is tantamount to full control over the [[logic]] of the world, or at least, that is as it seems. To almost anyone, this claim is flatly absurd, but it was accurate to Clover's attestation.

Clover terms their leader's ability (if not a Codec) "***Anekrízotos***” (meaning *ineradicable*). It is similar to Clover's *Stókhos* ability, carrying many of the same tenets of morality and protection, though much more unstoppable. However, just so, R. S. is apparently even more reluctant to use their ability for outsiders than the SBC's director is.



# Etymology
Dr. Langford's subordinates and claimed "family" call them, interchangeably, Dr. Langford's subordinates and claimed "family" call them, interchangeably, "**the old <span class="glitch" data-text1="woman&#34;" data-text2="man&#34;&#8199;">fellow"</span>**, "**the doctor**", or “**Doc**”. 

Though many members of SBC have occasionally seen interrogation, when interrogated about any apparent inaccuracy regarding Langford's alias, it appears to be impossible to "directly" describe.  Even Clover refers to it interchangeably as "*<span class="glitch" data-text1="father" data-text2="mother">guardian</span>*". 

Nobody of the Cell has claimed the ability to determine the true meaning behind the initialism "R. S.". The assumed full alias for Langford is **Reyes Sinclair Langford**, but this was a self-admitted "joke" made by [[Rise-and-Shine]].
