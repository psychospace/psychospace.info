The **place of asylum** in [[Raldena]], more accurately the **Lavas Hideaway**, is a location upon [[Mount Lavas]], overlooking the roads into and out of Raldena. It is labeled simply on the map as "asylum". There, in a mountain cottage, a mysterious "[[R. S. Langford|doc]]", apparently from the [[Fifth Institute]], watched over children who were born with [[Omen|omens]] running through their veins.

As of [[1243 PT]], [[Ciro Enfys]] and the future [[The Pitcher|Pitcher]] were being raised here.

The hideaway was safe from the effects of the fire which burned down Raldena in [[1244 PT]].

In [[1249 PT]], it became the location of the second [[Base (XI)|Base]] discovered by the victims of the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]]. During 1249 PT, and its time spent under the effects of the [[Confluence|conflux]], it was inhabited and still watched over by around 14 omen children, including [[Tom√°s Tosell]], [[Carla Soler]], and [[Ricki Erdona]].
