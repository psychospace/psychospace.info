The **S4**, also known as the **royal escort group**, is an adventuring party and Sacrosanct Squadron formed in late [[1250 PT]].

# History
This group was originally chartered by the Prince of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]], [[Lazuli Dino]], to escort his and [[Ildy]]'s return back to Sacred's [[Drastic|capitol]]. This group was originally selected as a result of their aid of [[Ikabod Caruso]], whom the Prince trusted and was working with. 

Following the [[Red Spark|kidnapping of the prince]] and the [[Dragonic War|advent of war]], the S4, for a variety of personal and extenuating reasons, resolved to save him. This led the party to reassemble the [[Golorr|Stone of Golorr]], meet and assist the [[visitant|visitants]] of the prince, and endure battle after battle on their journey. After many successful missions, the party embarked to Nortia.

# Membership

It was originally comprised of [[Arthur Graywell]], [[Chiave Neeman]], [[Serratura Neeman]], [[Eldral Levin]], and [[Shohei Integra]], but has since grown and shrunk over time. Along the prince's journey, they were expanded by the addition of [[Alexios Hawthorne]] and [[Star of the North]]. Later on, after most of the original group left or went on to secondary roles for varying reasons, the main group were bolstered by the addition of [[Volk Vendleberg]], [[Kessah]], [[Frances Jayne]], [[Even Baxly]], and ultimately even [[Serena Nortia]] in the flesh^[Serena had previously assisted the party [[monism|through]] Shohei.].

When Star left the group, the party took the name "S4", a name that would remain elusive as an abbreviation comprised of four S's.

The group also had myriad allies, such as [[Sekkan-shin]], the crews of their ships *[[Red Diamond]]* and *[[Wings of Dawn]]*, and other adventuring parties in [[The Runts]], [[The Unfortunate]], and the [[Windriders]].
