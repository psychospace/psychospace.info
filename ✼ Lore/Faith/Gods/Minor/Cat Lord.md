The **Cat Lord**, occasionally known as **Bast**, is a fickle deity whose influence is rarely seen but often manifests.

The patron deity of [[Catfolk]], rarely told of outside of their lore, the Cat Lord is a trickster who possesses the sight to see the potential chaos in every situation and steer fate towards its own desire. Many of the tabaxi's versions of myths tell the ample and important presence of the Cat Lord among the pantheon, while other races' interpretations barely make mention of the odd deity.

It is likely to be a child of [[Athemat]], but it is just as likely to have no progenitor, being a surviving force from long ago, similar to its counterpart and rival [[Eoremu]], the snake god.

It has a hatred for snakes and liars, who sabotage its foresight and its exploration by striking just outside of it, cutting off fate before it takes its course.

The few clerics (often tricksters) of the Cat Lord tell tales of their god's constantly shifting goals and aspirations, just as fickle as his children in the tabaxi and his inheritors in felines. This is not a drawback; the manic, almost random choices made by the Lord are parts of its exploration of the fullness of life and its mysteries.
