The **Infernal languages**, also called the **Diabolic languages**, compose the family of languages commonly spoken by [[Fiend|fiends]] and often found as immaculate knowledge in fiend [[Scion|scions]], such as [[Tiefling|tiefs]]. 

Words in Infernal-tongue are often considered [[Curse#Curse words|curses]] in other languages, due to the natural animosity between good and evil laced into their very being: some [[Infusion|magic items]] even react to them with disdain or [[echo|resonance]]. 

Infernal's languages all initially descended from [[Arckan]], but were translated and melded together with other, mortal languages, especially when it came time for [[devil|devils]] to forge tantalizing deals with the living. The modern form of Infernal is heavily influenced by a variety of mortal eras, with some words being loaned into [[Oa'Rovi]] and [[Shindani]].

The Infernal languages are characterized by sharp sounds, extended vowels, and unnatural gnashing and uncomfortable positioning of mouth-parts. Linguists assume this variance and "clashing" nature of the language is due to the similarly varied biologies of the fiends that speak it. It is traditionally written using an adapted, reductive form of Arckan script, typically with more logographic representations of concepts than modern [[spell]] language. A form of the Shindani script can be used to write Infernal syllabary, though the relative simplicity risks losing Infernal's natural edges and idiosyncrasies.
