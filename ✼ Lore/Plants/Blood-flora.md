Native to Northern [[Bullion]] and originally found in [[League of Joriele|Joriele]], **blood-flora**^[Hyphenation is subjective.] are members of a large family of hardy [succulent plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succulent_plant), some of which can channel [[magic]]. Their petals, leaves, and roots are typically bright red in coloration, and produce sticky, dark-red viscera when wounded, resembling the blood of many creatures.

Blood-flora express an atypical ability compared to other plant life to drink water in many unconventional forms, such as contaminated water toxic to most other organic life. They often outperform other plant life in arid locales, expertly rationing out what water its lengthy, thick roots can manage to find. In temperate climates, they grow best through commensally expressing their root system along trees or in thick lines. 

Blood-flora are best exemplified by [[Bloodberry|bloodberries]], their type species and a common garden escapee throughout the [[Mer de Vide]]. They typically bloom most vibrantly in mid-summer.

True to their name, blood-flora have two disputed folk origins, both to do with blood. In the first origin, they are said to have first been created when a [[Divinity|god]]'s blood was spilled in Bullion, creating a fountain of youth around which these succulents eagerly drank it up. In the other origin, a [[harengon]] was mauled to death while stealing for his family, and its dying wish was to not let his family see him acting out in such shame, and so beautiful flowers grew about the body.
