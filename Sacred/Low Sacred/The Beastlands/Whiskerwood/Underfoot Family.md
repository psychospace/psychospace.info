[[Halfling]] clan who have lived many long lives amongst [[The Whiskerwood]].

Once upon a time, they held the capabilities to magically inter and pacify any creature who attacked them using the magic of the [[Tree of Time]], allowing them to study the beasts and investigate them. This was a boon granted to them by the [[Cat Lord]], a rare sight outside of [[the Beastlands]].

However, this capability was taken from them when the power of the [[Heart of the Woods]] was seized by giantkind, upsetting the balance of [[the Beastlands]] and giving rise to the [[Giant Forest]]. The halflings capitulated the artifact to the [[Giant|giants]] and eventually found that the arrangement was to everyone's benefit, although the ability of "time-chill" was forever lost.

This legend eventually gave rise to the "Undergarden", a belief that the denizens of [[Kibangan]]'s depths contains a similar ability.
