The **Militia of the Blue Cinder Crest**, most often just called the **Blue Cinders** and often simplified to just "*the militia*", is the unofficial civilian paramilitary, acting as a general law-enforcing organ, of [[The Shibboleth]]. 

The Militia is an observer-member of the Shibboleth, whose charter ensures their continued cooperation with any other law-enforcing bodies.

# Symbology 
Their well-known symbol is a trail-marker of blue paint, literally a "blue blaze". When a blue spot is seen prominently on a standard, the people of the remnant know help is on the way. They are also represented with blue flora, some of which represent "nature in trouble".  A militiaman is often known under the [[MÃ¤nyya]] title of *gaucho*, translated into [[Shindani]] as *countryman/woman*; the Blue Cinders gave rise to the concept of a [[Wildwalker]].

# Structure and duties
They are primarily organized as a loose coalition more than a standing army, formed itself of more regional guilds that then offer assistance to companies across [[Bullion]], which then take the form of local constabularies.

The Militia serves many communities all across the remnant, especially those that struggle under threats of violence. Comprised mostly of volunteers paid through a tax, the Blue Cinders represent the first and best line of defense against monsters, raiders, outlaws, and more. Their mission statement is to protect Bullion at all costs. However, their authority is quite low when challenged, despite their almost ubiquitous nature. Many humans especially serving successive generations to a family. 

# History

The Blue Cinders are the most modern form of a tradition which began with the [[Cinder Sun Rangers]]. During the [[Bullion Civil War]], the Cinder Suns were indispensible allies, assisting along the difficult fronts and battle-lines late into that conflict. As a result of being well-regarded at the close of the civil war, their successor organization were granted observership of the Shibboleth.

As with their predecessors, the Militia take their name ultimately from [[Shaelyn Ealdwine]], a [[Human]] folk hero and legendary bounty hunter who fought with hellfire she won from a [[Devil]].
