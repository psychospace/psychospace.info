**Dakota Hazelwick** is a 292-year old^[As of [[‚çü Twin Fantasy]].] [[Elf|elven]]-[[Beastkin|therian]] [[Witchcraft|witch]], widely mythologized as the **Graven Witch of [[Mezcoatl]]**. They are also known as the Oracle of Sunfall. 

A prolific ally of the [[Bullion]] sect of the modern [[Coven of the Night]], Dakota is the author of much of the modern caster-side discourse on witchcraft's place in society. To most, they are believed to be a shapechanger, as each time they appear their physical gender appears different.

A well-traveled person across the [[Skysea|skyseas]], Dakota is believed to be partly a [[Worldline#Transcendence|multiversal traveler]], using witchcraft to channel themselves to other worlds. Their windmill tower laboratory, [[Colina Azul]], has sometimes been reported floating or missing for several days before returning. 

It is widely believed through Coven news that Dakota's most recent companion for such travels is a harpy by the name of [[Vim]], or sometimes an [[angel]] of ill-defined description.
