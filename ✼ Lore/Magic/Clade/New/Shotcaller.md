A **shotcaller** is an informal [[Clade|clade]] of [[New Magic|new magic]], which, due to its simplicity and teachability, allows an everyman a defense against the greater threats of post-[[Zero Day]]. Many shotcallers are employed or used by the [[Fifth Institute]], as the ability is relatively easy to train or find propensity for.

# Description
Typically, a shotcaller is a tactical position. fields a small array of weak-but-purposeful psionic talents, with an eye towards increasing their perception of [[Off-wave|changes]] in [[Psychospace]]. This enhanced understanding allows a shotcaller to see beyond their conscious selves and view a conflict as a series of chess moves, granting them insight into the motions and limitations of both sides. 

Their comprehension to the flow to [[Logic]] renders their ability-set an effective, if rudimentary, defense against [[Reality-Bending|reality-benders]], since at the very least they can be detected (and in best-case, their advantages can be altogether negated).

## Commonality
Encountering a skilled shotcaller is almost always an uphill battle, and a common enough one in remote parts of Bullion. 

If the militia can manage to recruit one, they will even the odds against a shotcaller with a shotcaller of their own: a practice which becomes more and more distinct the farther north you are, as the communities turn to the Institute to offer aid.

# Etymology
The term originated as [[Bullion]]-[[Blue Cinder Militia|militia]] slang for a minor [[Psion|psion]], specifically one in target-finding or tactician roles. It was originally a term for similarly tactically-positioned prophets or [[Divination|diviners]].
