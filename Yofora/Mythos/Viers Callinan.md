![[âŽ‹ Needs Expansion]]
**Viers Callinan** was an infamous turn-of-the-millennium [[Wizardry|wizard]], who answered to no government and traveled the world in search of many magical and divine secrets. He was obsessed with discovering a ritual path to [[Mortal God Ritual|godhood]] and a way to translate himself into [[Welkin]]. 

His primary base, the *Nosebleed*, was located inside a demiplane.

# History
At some point, Viers encountered [[Logan Caruso]] and later wrote about him.

At some point, Viers had an apprentice named [[Ghen Sherak]] who discovered the process of [[Lifeblinding]].

With little artificing knowledge, Viers studied physics and thermodynamics to replicate [[Nunes Daedal]]'s blueprints and craft the first [[Firearm|firearms]] in around [[990 PT]]. These early weapons were mostly put to work defending his various bases.

## Encounter with Ink
In [[1011 PT]], Viers had acquired a mysterious near-angelic cadaver from a hallowed graveyard on [[Dawndust]], but shortly after had to trap it within a magic circle to assure testing could continue on the comatose body. Slowly, through Viers' testing, he reported that scrying on his body produced visions of immense light with darkness at its edges, and each time he scried, more and more dark would encroach the light. Viers eventually had to file away the body for fear of his own safety, something he usually never did, as he began to hear the voice of a demon echoing throughout his soul the more he worked with the body. 

The body, dubbed [[Ink of Angelblood]], was locked up in the *Nosebleed* where it remained until present day.

## Encounter with the Signet
At some point, according to his notes, Viers obtained contact with the [[Elseworld|crashed world]], a world in which [[Psychospace]] itself had collapsed. Continuing his obsession, he believed that the Welkin could be accessible through "crashed" versions of holy sites. 

Exploring this hypothesis, he had discovered, in an alternate version of [[Aet'Caldwyn]], what he dubbed the [[L'ipotesi|Slingshot]], able to bring it back to his home universe.

Shortly thereafter, he disappeared without a trace, late into the [[11th century PT]].
## Legacy
The *Nosebleed* was uncovered by [[Wren Doggabone]][^1] in and around [[1231 PT]], where it was brought to the [[Nail of Nortia]]. At that time, the Signet was moved to [[Sinag National Library]] at the behest of [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qaulhain]] interests.
