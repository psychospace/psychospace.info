**Raldena** is an abandoned mining town nearby to [[Regina]] on the [[Regina Steppe]], in the [[Emirate of Qaulhain]]. It sat upon the side of [[Mount Lavas]].

For many years, the mines of Raldena produced a economically-stable amount of coal, [[Silver piece|silver]], and other materials. However, in [[1244 PT]], the cave system began to burn, and the pine forests around the town went up with it, destroying much of the town which existed beforehand. The town, subsequently, was abandoned.

By the time of [[1249 PT]], the town had become something of a local legend, with all of its inhabitants apparently moved out. The smoke and smog was still choking and required protection. When the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]] occurred, or around that time, the smog grew to encompass the whole mountain. This became a point of inquiry of the local [[Chirologist|chirologists]].
