The **Empress of Nortia** (or **Emperor of Nortia**) is the title of the ruler over the [[Great Nortian Empire]], assumed as the matriarch of the [[Nortian imperial family]]. If reappointed in times of emergency (as it was following [[Zero Day]]), her acting authority is known as **Empress / Emperor Regnant**. She traditionally has a counsel in the one immediately behind her in succession, known as [[Successor (Nortia)|Successor]].

The role of Empress is considered head of [[Temple of the Uforiad|church]] (as the Prime Orchestrator of the [[Uforia|Dreaming Dragon]]) and head of state, the ultimate authority across most of the remnants of the empire. For most of the existence of the empire, the title of Empress was characterized as a feudal dictator, though as one with a responsibility to hear out her people's concerns through [[monism]] and as head of church. 

Since the [[0 PT|turn of the epoch]], the Empress's role has been gradually reduced in scope to democratize, thanks to the admission of roles like the [[Lord of Law]], though her authority is still considered extremely important, if not final.
