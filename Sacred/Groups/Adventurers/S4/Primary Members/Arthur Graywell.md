**Arthur Graywell** is a [[hobgoblin]] wizard and member of the [[S4]]. Brothers with [[Hieron Dredge]] and [[Igor Ingolstadt|Igor]], Arthur is an incredibly accomplished wizard who aided the prince and later became one of the people fighting to save the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] during the [[Dragonic War]]. He is 55 as of [[1251 PT]], making him the oldest member by maturity, a role which he has filled since the group's founding.

# History
Arthur was born on [[1194 PT]], to a legion of hobgoblins in the Grandglass Plains mired in internal collusion.

In [[1212 PT]], when he was 18, his clan was razed to the ground by a burgeoning adventuring party named [[Critical Hit]], after they had harassed the nearby settlements and welched on several agreements. His twin brothers, Igor and Hieron Dredge, went on their own paths, but only Hieron ever got back into contact with him. Arthur was a nomad for quite a while, offering insight to those who would need him. However, he eventually landed himself into a detective job in [[The Well]].

In [[1235 PT]], the detective suffered a major blow to his reputation, when he earned the ire of [[House Nautilus]] during the [[Synchronia-Nautilus affair]].
## Current Affairs
In [[1250 PT]], Arthur decided to answer the prince's summons to [[Rainbow Ridge]]. Helping to discern the truth behind the disappearance of [[Pendant]], he joined the Royal Escort Group, and was thus at the capital city when the [[Red Spark]] occurred, obtaining the [[Wand of Mythos]].
# Personality
For much of his life, Arthur could be described as abrasive, difficult to work with, and generally self-concerned, though he always had a focus for the truth and for ultimately doing the right thing. 

# Appearance
Arthur has red, leathery skin and a dapper sense of fashion.
