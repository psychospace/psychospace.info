**Aboleth**, also known as **alghollthus**, are primal aquatic creatures from [[Out There]]. 

# History
They first influenced [[The Heavens|the Heavens]] during [[Old world|the Shatter]], before the [[Divinity|gods]] arose. At this time, they seized control over infantile mortal enterprise, seeking to dominate and become new gods over the dying world, creating pocket spaces they could control outside the realm. 

However, the arising of the [[Age of the Gods|new pantheon]] imposed a rebellious spirit in the [[First Magicians]], whom unto that point were being subjugated by the alghollthus. The First Ones fought hard to destroy and defile the aberrant beings' works and shut them out, forcing them to recuperate. 

In response, the aboleth slowly gathered strength before attempting whole-heartedly to wipe the slate clean with a [[Collapse state|new universe]]. But in the wake of [[the Gathering]], as well as the will to survive, their control over [[chaos]] was mitigated, and the world grew prosperous without them.

In the eons since, they have spent their idle years devouring the knowledges of countless people, attempting to gather the knowledge needed to revenge against the gods.

The aboleth created the [[kuo-toa]] to power their [[Ritual|rituals]].
