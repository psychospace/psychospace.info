**Yohann Xiala** is a [[gith|githyanki]] druid who is allied with the [[Nortian Conspiracy|Conspiracy]], unique in her own right for her heritage alone. Supposedly, she was reported to come from [[Umazia]]. There's no known gith settlements in Umazia, so it may be an underdarker, but being commissioned for a special task force had [[Serena Nortia]] pondering if they're even a [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] at all.

Like all of the Conspirators, Yohann normally wears the [[Cloak of Excelsio]].

Yohann uses a staff that's deeply imbued with both the [[Dark Sea]] and [[Wild Magic]].
