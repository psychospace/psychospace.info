**Valto** was an arcanoloth who was part of the second phase of [[Heartknock]]. He was approached about four months ago, and was paid to enter into a deal. As a result of the Heartknock's goals of acquiring knowledge about the inner nature of magic and life, Valto was easy to coerce. 

Rust and Blood, local thieves, work for him, although they are only *local* thieves and worth little concern in the grand scheme.

About two weeks prior to meeting the [[S4]], Valto killed and buried two [[Victory Starscouts|Starscouts]] from [[Ladybug]] (Giraldo Petri and Raymond Wiseman), as they departed on their duty after hearing that a monster attack befell the area near the [[Phantasm]] of [[Lago di Gattini]]. They were deigned to investigate the area but ended up on the wrong side of an arcanaloth. 

The Heartknock hoped to keep the inhabitants of both sides of the remnant unawares while they spark the [[Tree of Time]]'s energy, and Valto's incursion is key in preventing more discovery. Since [[The Whiskerwood]] is not known to take kindly to the dangers of the outside world, the forests nearby would make an excellent base should they go undiscovered: quite literally right under their enemies' noses. 

Unfortunately, he was chased away from the Whiskerwood by the efforts of the S4.

## Post-campaign
Valto answered to the contracts written by "Tehtiogiss" or “Ten-Ton Gus”, a yagnoloth who is at or near the top of the hierarchy of the Heartknock's half-hearted attempts to curry favor with the [[Scarlet Skies]]. Valto had ambitions of rising above his station, since he really did not fear the efforts of the Kingdles, but he did fear Contessa [[Scarla Nitrum]]. 

He hoped to crack the identity of the conspiracy’s leaders and use that blackmail to take over the conspiracy for himself, even though that was a horrible idea and Nitrum or Parasom would surely kill him long before he reaches that point. 

And sure enough, he was.
