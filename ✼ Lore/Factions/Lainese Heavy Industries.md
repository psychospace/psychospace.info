**Lainese Heavy Industries**, typically shortened to **LHI**, is a [heavy industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_industry) and shipping trust, one of the largest and most well-recognized companies on the face of [[Bullion]]. Named for its home of [[Lainesia]], LHI owns and operates much of the remnant's [[Train|train lines]], using the [[Blue Cinder Militia|Cinders]] to protect them: and, through a cooperation with their subsidiary [[Arkwright Improvement Company|ImCo]] and the supply company [[Diesterthan Materials|DMAT]], has also worked to support the infrastructure bringing [[Dust tunnel|dust networks]] from skysea to skysea. 

It operates an interremnantal [[airship|ptero]]-logistics and [[Train|railroad]] empire spanning the entire [[Mer de Vide]], bringing its owners, the great noble [[House Arkwright]] and their philanthropic endeavors, extreme renown and wealth. In addition, LHI conducts many off-remnant ventures and operations, bringing these technological revolutions elsewhere. 

It has been estimated that almost 275,000 people are employed by LHI or their subsidiaries, most as infantry for the purpose of securing their investments. It is euphemistically known as the "sharpened diamond of [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qaulhain]]".

# History
The trust was initially formed between the [[Golden Council]], the [[Wabi Isletary Concordat]], and the greater [[The Shibboleth|Shibboleth]] of [[Bullion]] in [[1077 PT]]. Its initial charter stated LHI's goal was to ensure the remnant remained secured and unified (following the [[Bullion Civil War]]). 

It declared its first responsibility to be to supplying the standing law-enforcement organs of the Shibboleth, such as the [[Blue Cinder Militia]] and [[Sganyodaiyo]]. These would receive both necessary and cutting-edge weaponry, items, magic, and vessels (such as [[Airship|airships]]). Its second responsibility was to conduct trade with [[Archipel]], who helped secure them additional sources of materials.

Through acquisitions of existing mining and manufacturing companies and trusts, the Shibboleth forged the LHI's aims in steel. Over the [[12th century PT]], the company grew by leaps and bounds, through careful outsourcing and working with other sectors inside the industrial cores of the remnant. Over that same time, it accrued new membership and allies, especially those in the [[Great Nortian Empire]], who began to help them innovate and acquire more contracts abroad.
