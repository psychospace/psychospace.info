**Birds** are a group of warm-blooded vertebrate [[Creature|creatures]], with almost all fielding the ability to fly through the [[Skysea|skyseas]]. They are mostly associated with the [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]] of [[air]], but mostly nest on land.

Birds are found throughout the Heavens, and many follow migratory routes in accordance with the [[Weather]] patterns of the Planet.

Birds usually hunt [[fish]] and insects if they hunt at all, and are usually hunted by sapient creatures. Some birds with high [[Senzai|senzai]] were among the first animals to learn a rudimentary form of farming.

# Birds in culture
Birds, like [[Frog|frogs]], appear to be uniquely old and significant as a caste of creature. 

Owing to ancient records (such as the [[Apocrypha of Winds]]), birds are apparently of a similar [[soul]] to [[Dinosaur|dinosaurs]], and fit most of the general descriptors of other reptiles.

The influence of civilization on the habits and diets of modern birds is significant, with birds like seagulls, pigeons, and ravens being characterized by their relation to people. 

Many current and previous inhabitants of [[the Above]] have taken on properties and appearances of birds, such as [[Tengu|tengu]], [[shisk|shisks]], [[Harpy|harpies]], and [[strix]]. [[Chimera|Chimeric]] experimentation in the past with birds such as falcons and eagles have produced often-stable fusions that eke out their own natural niches, such as [[Owlbear|owlbears]] and [[griffon|griffons]].
