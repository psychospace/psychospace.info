**Slimes** and variant creatures, collectively "oozes", are strange beings which lack a solid, fixed shape, and whose [[body|body]] constitutions often contain all or nearly all of their vital essence. 

# Creation
 Slimes are often the byproduct (intentionally or otherwise) of misused [[Magic|magic]], similar to [[Gremishka]]. Specifically, slimes are created as a result of flubbed [[alchemy]], due to contaminants, inexperienced potioneers, or incorrect recipes. In a typical instance, while channeling an effect into the potion [[Viewpoint property|through their mind]], the potioneer allows too much of the [[Vibe|collective unconsciousness]] to flow into the mixture, at which point a kind of cruddy [[Soul|soul]] takes form. 
 
 Slimes can also form as a result of natural processes which allow something similar to take form, often when natural magic "goes rogue" (e.g. because of an invasive species) and begins to absorb / copy bits and blobs of emotion or the [[Divine Equation]].

# Behavior
As creatures themselves, slimes require a degree of sustenance and thus have a sense of self-preservation, though unlike most creatures this sustenance can come from many inorganic things. 

# Colonization
Slimes that aren't spawned alone often form various partnerships, including colonies. A colony of slimes will often homogenize into one united will, but just as often will remain separated and considered by one another, like members of a council.

[[Mimic|Mimics]] are special slimes or slime colonies which, in the process of comprehending the collective consciousness, gain information about perception and certain objects, which they use to their advantage to nourish themselves. Other classes of mimic include [[Oblex|oblexes]] — which can devour whole personas and replicate them to nosh on [[Dream|dreams]], essentially consuming roleplaying for breakfast — and [[Sliver|slivers]] like [[Crony]], who create a "mask" with which they can act and obtain rare objects without arousing suspicion. In Crony's case, they enjoy the silver off coins, which further reinforces the horde and allows it to keep some manner of form.
