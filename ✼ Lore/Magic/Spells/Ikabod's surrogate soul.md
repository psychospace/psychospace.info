***Ikabod's surrogate soul***, named for [[Ikabod Caruso|its creator]], is a [[spell]] which was invented in [[1250 PT]].

# Effects

Using remains, the spell creates a creature, filling in the gaps, through Vibe and light. These remains can include physical remains, archaeological pieces, fragments of their [[soul]], or a [[Soul bond|powerful bond]] you share with the target.

The creature, termed a "[[Visitant]]", does not have a complete, usable soul after this spell is cast. To gain a [[Soul]], the creation must spend 9 months undisturbed with the creator expending a 6th-level spell slot each day, or the creator can use [[Lifeblinding]] to instantiate a soul immediately at risk to themselves. In both cases, the soul's instantiation brings the soul's intelligence and maturity to their state at around the time the remains were created. If the remains are of a creature who died of old age, the visitant will appear to be around their late teens.

The more you know about the creature's original form, the more accurate the creation becomes to its original form. With a fragment of a soul, the creature's form will always be nearly-identical, with only one or two slight phenotypical differences (such as eye-color). In both instances, the soul's personality and identity will be forged over time, like a child's.
