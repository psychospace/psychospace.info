**Counterspell** is an [[Antimagic|antimagic]] [[spell]] of variable [[arcane complexity]].

With it, a number of pulses are sent through local [[Psychospace|psychospace]] to shut down non-specific [[psychic code]], as it is being [[Compilation|compiled]] by an enemy. The caster of the counterspell must be able to direct the pulses towards the enemy in question. 

If the number of pulses exceeds the circular complexity of the enemy's [[spell]], the pulses equalize the spell's effects, and they never take effect. Otherwise, it is largely a matter of luck whether or not the energy will equalize. The higher the complexity level of the counterspell, the higher level of spell that can be countered without needing to rely on luck.
