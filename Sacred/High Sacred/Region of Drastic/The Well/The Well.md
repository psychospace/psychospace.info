The **Well** is a neighboring city to [[Drastic]]. The town was known during the time of the [[Carapa Republic]] as an "[[Phantasm#mirage|oasis]]" that allowed them access to [[Mount Celestia]] with incredible ease, and even today that remains true, giving the town its namesake.

Here, many people search for their fortunes in casinos, crime, and espionage, leading a counter-movement of detectives to stop them.
