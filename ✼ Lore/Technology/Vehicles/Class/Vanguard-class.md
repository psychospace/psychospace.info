The *Vanguard*-class is a wooden [[airship]] often used by both high-profile passengers and low-ranking scouts in the [[Pinwheel|Pinwheeler]] Military. Vanguards, being one of the smallest non-medical vessels in recent activity in the Ioyon fleet, are extremely cheap to make and equally cheap to maintain, requiring only a slight amount of engineering or carpenting skill to keep skyworthy.

As a result of their cheap price, they are often seen as "pity ships", given that the limited amount of crew and passengers that can remain aboard safely is low. It is ideal for use as a command vessel or support ship, able to hide in the shadows of larger, thicker ships to provide aid or act as a bridge between vessels to cycle out injured crew. They are handy to use in flyovers: although they lack the heft necessary to carry a substantial payload of explosives, their hulls are still thick enough to gain vital information on the layout of enemy strongholds from afar without risking getting shot down.

Its wingspan is white and feathery, and spans about 20 feet from tip to hull. It is powered by a white [[Quasidragon]].
