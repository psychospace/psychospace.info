The **City & Castle** guards of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], also called the C&C, wear distinctive pink and blue on their armaments. They defend the streets of [[Drastic]] and are always the first to enjoy the innovations created at the [[Tower of Electron]]. They are based out of the [[Mansion of Keys]].

The lead member of the C&C, and thus the master of the Mansion is [[Dora Maxwell]], a [[Witchcraft|warlock]] to [[Puretza]], apprenticed by [[Ridd of Chained-Earth]].
