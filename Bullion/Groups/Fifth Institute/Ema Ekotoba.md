Dr. **Ema Forossa Ekotoba** is a [[Sirrhad|Sirrhadi]] [[dwarf]] and one of the most premier researchers of [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]] and [[Broadcaster|Broadcasters]], working for the [[Fifth Institute|Conservatory of Karyos]] as of [[1285 PT]]. 

A magus and extremely notorious in her field, she is credited with helping further the process of understanding the properties of [[New Magic]], writing many formal definitions of their processes. She is host to a piece of [[Triplicate#043-I|the Triplicate]], and acts as one of the Conservatory's [[Alect Keeper|Alect Keepers]], serving as the keeper of [[Jackalyne Aton]].


# History
Ema Ekotoba's rise to fame began with the advent of new magic, although she had been a scholar for some time before then, as a protégée of [[Mujtaba Shahin]].

Eventually, Shahin surrendered his role as Alect Keeper, with his choice for continuing the role being Ema.

When Shahin further had to sequester his research after the [[1284 PT#^315310|fire at Sinag Library]], he entrusted Ema with his piece of the Triplicate, the first lynchpin formally identified.
# Abilities
Ekotoba is known first and foremost for being incredibly intelligent, sometimes known by her peers as the smartest dwarf that ever lived. Despite extensively studying them, Ekotoba is not a [[Broadcaster]] herself, admittedly rare in her position.

Her specialty is in her extremely high [[Bias coagulation#Antibias|antibias]], the highest factor ever recorded, a training that has come in handy throughout her expertise, though it does make her come across as rather dry of wit, unwilling to interpret much of anything without concrete proof.

This extreme resilience to reality-bending renders her able to research in difficult environments and interface with many lynchpins that would otherwise permanently change those who interact with them. Through becoming host to a number of lynchpins, she has apparently enhanced her body somewhat -- sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally.
