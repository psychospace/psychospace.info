**Tenora Kyrylo Yegim** was a [[Umazia|Umazian]] [[Transmutation]] [[Wizardry|wizard]], a human man who was excommunicated from [[Rainbow Ridge]] after it had been discovered he was kidnapping orphans from the village and attempting to use them for some twisted experiments. It is known that he had two children, but only one survived to adulthood, [[Theresa Leighton]].

After it was discovered that he had murdered over a dozen children in this crime, his exile elevated to a manhunt. He was then tried, found guilty, and executed by [[Medved Vendleberg]] on the order of King [[Hadro Dino]]. This all occurred during Tessa's time in the dragoons, and if she was completely honest, it was a long time coming.

His tower, then called "[[Maline Tower]]" after Tessa's middle name, was used as a lease and Tessa's home after the war, until the new homes in [[Lond Point]] were constructed. Once she'd moved out, it continued use as a lease, watched over by Abyz and by local friends, until a missive came in the mail, and Tessa sold it and the lake near it to Ikabod Caruso in 1240 PT for the sum of around 10,000 [[Gold piece|gold]].
