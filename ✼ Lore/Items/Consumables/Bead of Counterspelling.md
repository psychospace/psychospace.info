A **bead of counterspelling** is a consumable bead of [[Hepatizon|hepatizon]], shaped like a triangular prism, which, when crushed, exudes a localized [[antimagic|antimagic]] effect, effectively [[Counterspell|counterspelling]] a spell of a specific strength.

Certain groups, such as [[NIMROD]], oft equips its members with these on a necklace of sorts, muting the effects of enemy attack or support spells. The beads have a color indicating their strength, and also grow larger and more rare the more potent they are.

>>When a spell is cast within 40 feet of a wearer and the wearer can see the caster, they can use their reaction to crush the bead. If the bead's level is equal to or more than that of the spell, the spell is cancelled out, engulfed in flames of the bead's color. Else, nothing happens. Either way, the bead is expended.
>>
>>A spell cast using a sorcerer's metamagic or through similar subtle features is fast and slight enough that this bead can't be used against it.
>>
>>Higher level spells are generally fairly obviously more powerful, at least to a caster. However, it may not be as clear to the general public. As part of this reaction, the wearer can make a DC (10 + spell's level) Intelligence (Arcana) check to determine if the spell is of a level the bead can break. If they succeed, they learn if they can or can't use their bead on it based on context clues. After making this check (regardless of success or failure), they choose whether or not to break the bead. A creature automatically succeeds on this check if the creature saw a bead or counterspelling effect cancel the spell before.
>>
>>Necklaces of these beads generally contain 1d4+1 of these beads with 1 or 2 variations in level. Looted necklaces often contain 1d4-1 beads instead.

>>To detect magic, these items give off *abjuration* magic.
