A **[body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_(biology))** is the literal, [[Plane#Realm|Material]] form part of a [[Creature]], connected to its [[Soul|soul]] and [[Echo|shadow]] by the [[Silver cord]].

It is known that many [[Divinity|gods]] have had bodies, which have since ascended into [[Welkin]] as part of the [[Mortal God Ritual|process]] of becoming [[immortal]].
