The [[Carapa Republic]] once evidently tried to control [[Low Sacred]], as their ruins dot that region as well. Those of the Carapa who attempted to seize Low Sacred were known asÂ **Unitors**, a derogatory appropriated term from [[Oa'Rovi]] which means "dissident" or "asshole". They seem to have had a much different cultural impact on the region than their [[High Sacred]] counterparts.

Unitor ruins are notably different than Carapaean ruins. There's more of a function to what Unitors were building, more of an interest in investigating the limits of ancient magic. In a way, even though it was the same governmental force, its as if there was a separate culture amongst them. Even today, more Unitor ruins are being uncovered across Low Sacred, and we're understanding more about them.
