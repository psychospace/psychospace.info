**Halmer Kraig** is the pen name of a particular [[ysoki]] gunslinger of the [[Blue Cinder Militia|Blue Cinders]]. An impeccable showman, Kraig is the prototypical [[Wildwalker|huaso]] of his time, master of pen, sword, and pistol.


# Works
He is himself the subject of a popular series of autobiographical dime novels in [[Bullion]], known as the ***ratón sin nombre***^[[[Mänyya]] for "mouse with no name"] series. 
## Inspiration

According to him, Kraig's family originated in the [[Siella Valley]], where they have assisted in every war in history fought in the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]], including the most recent [[Bullion Civil War|civil war]]. 

As Kraig tells it, this heritage spent protecting the homestead has inspired him to dramatize and enjoin the heroics of the [[Sganyodaiyo]] and [[Blue Cinder Militia|Blue Cinders]]. This was especially after hearing tell from Kraig's grandmother, apparently one of the outriders who brought in the [[Witch-King]].
# History

Kraig was born in [[Arnecca]], and was a child at the time of [[Zero Day]]. Shortly after becoming an adult, in [[1254 PT]], he joined the Blue Cinders, and was compatriot to [[Cordyte Amak]], the constable who originated the practice of [[Shotcaller|shotcalling]]. 

His first novel was published in [[1266 PT]], with a yearly output of three books from each year onward until around [[1280 PT]], when he announced he would be slowing his efforts to spend more time with his family, continuing to produce one to two books each year following.

In early [[1285 PT]], Kraig and his immediate family went apparently missing, leaving a single letter with [[Pablo's Masterworks Publishing|his publicist]] alluding to the fact that he could be found at [[Empty Lake]]. This widely stirred interest in the modern myth, as it appears Kraig was retiring in the midst of his most popular era.
