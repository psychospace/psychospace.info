The **Star Maiden** is a [[Divinity|goddess]] who oversaw [[Dark Sea|the cosmos]], rumored to have been abandoned in [[Bullion]] once long ago. It is said that she was a "word made form". Almost none of her lore remains from whenever her peak was.

[[Celen Odoxil]] is a noted cleric of hers, founder and proselyte of the [[Nova Luz]].
