A **fylgja** (*fill-gee-ah*, plural *fylgjur*), **guide**, or **warden spirit**, is a piece of the [[soul]] which binds a [[creature]]'s fate to the [[Divinity|gods]], and itself is bonded to the [[Body|bodily]] fluids, such as blood. It governs a soul's creation, guiding their development in both life and death. It often takes the form of an animal, though it can also appear in other forms. ^325410

It is generally created of [[chaos]] energy, and is in part the literal manifestation of the [[silver cord]]. *Fylgjur* are known to duplicate and serve many members of a family at once. [[Sorcery|Sorcerers]] have their bloodline modified through the *fylgja*.

These entities, sometimes manifesting and evolving more separately and uniquely from the soul it is borne of, are necessary for the rite of [[resurrection]] or for casting [[Magic]] in general, as it is the *fylgja* which allows a soul to overcome its [[Light (property)|Darkness]]. 

[[Beastkin|Shifters]] are an example of a people with a more distinctive *fylgja*, passed down in the blood, and the [[Angel|angelic]] guide of some [[Aasimar]] are notable for being *fylgja* entirely independent of the host.

Souls without a *fylgja* are incapable of travel to [[Unwri]] to receive rest. They may become [[undead]] or unbound by [[logic]].
