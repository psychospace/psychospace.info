**Succession** is a bloodline [[Magic|magic]] ability, said to be a fragment of divine strength, allowing a person to send their memories, emotions, and [[soul]] to another, extending another's life upon the original's [[death]]. It is sometimes considered to be an extreme form of [[telepathy]].

[[Evangel|Evangels]] were known to possess this ability, though apparently, the sixth sense appears to have been recessed in any living offshoot such as the [[aasimar]], potentially diluted. This specific ability is now inherited by the [[quori]] of [[kalashtar]].

[[TRUE NAME (collective)|TRUE NAME]] is also capable of succession inside the same generation, through an unknown magical means, able to craft a hivemind with it.
