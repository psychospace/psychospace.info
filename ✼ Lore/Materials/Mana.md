>[!question|ttl-c bg-c-blue] Not to be confused with [[Mana (plane)|its namesake]], a plane of existence.
---

**Mana** is a solid or fluid form of [[Vibe]], its "physical" shape, taking properties of [[Light (property)|Light or Darkness]], crystallized. It is unique from [[Lux]], its more unstable transversal form; mana exists purely on one side of reality or the other. It possesses latent energy that can be leveraged for [[Magic]].

It shares its name with [[Mana (plane)|a legendary plane]] said to be the [[Flipside]] of [[Welkin]]. In both instances, the word is an [[Arckan]] one which is translated as "intention as power".
  
Mana usually forms in medium to small sized crystals, but larger mana caverns may have existed in the past, as evidenced by an abundance of the stuff in the [[Colossal Ocean]]. The properties of the [[Dark Sea]] cause Mana to be formed in excesses, usually coming back down to the planet in the forms of comets.
