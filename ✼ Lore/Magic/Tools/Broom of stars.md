The **broom of stars** is a magical staff invented by [[Werwin Krara]], intended to assist the custodians of the [[Sacred Royal Ultra]]. The intended use of this item is as a disposal tool for magical errors, scattering mistakes to ash.

>>*Wondrous item, rare*
>>
>>This item can't be set on fire. When the broom detects danger, it changes the end of the broom to be in the shape of a five-pointed star, and increases its DC to 15 until the danger vanishes. You can also mute this effect (no action required); by default, it looks like a non-magic broom.
>>
>>The broom has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast *Melf's minute* meteors, *faerie fire*, or *burning hands* from it. You cast the 3rd-level version of any spell you cast. The DC of these spells is the DC of the item. Any spells cast from this item don't require concentration, but only one of each spell can take effect at a time.
>>
>>It can also turn into a broom of flying (30 feet flying), its original form; this takes an action and a charge. It also deals 5 fire damage to creatures whose spaces it passes over within 5 feet, clouded by "exhaust fumes". A creature doesn't take this damage if it is resistant to fire or doesn't need to breathe, or if it is the rider. While it acts as a broom of flying, the item can't "concentrate on" or cast spells. It stays a broom of flying until it is held upright or dawn breaks, upon which it resumes being a magical staff.
>>
>>The item regains 1d6 + 1 charges daily at dawn. The item will resist using its final charge for spellcasting while it doesn't detect danger: if the item only has 1 charge left and isn't in the shape of a star, it doesn't react to attempts to cast spells from it. When this item has 0 charges, roll 1d20. On a 1, it combusts and burns to nothing.
>>
>> Spells this item casts ignore resistance to fire damage. Whenever you roll 1 on a damage die for any of these spells, you can instead treat that as a 2. Spells cast from this item can also ignite objects that the text of the spell say can't normally be set on fire.
>> 
>> To detect magic, this item gives off *evocation* magic.
