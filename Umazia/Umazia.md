![[âŽ‹ Needs Expansion]]
**Umazia** is a [[Remnant]] which has a tropical rainforest climate, with the species diversity to match. Its primary citizenry are [[orc|orcs]] and half-orcs, though many other peoples exist here, both in the open and in her Underdark. 

A source of an abundance of natural resources, until the [[Dragonic War]], the remnant of Umazia was largely exploited as a source of labor for the [[Great Nortian Empire]]. For hundreds of thousands of years, Umazia has been a cradle of civilization. It is said Umazia was the very first remnant to take to the skies aboard primeval [[Airship|airships]] constructed by the [[First Magicians]]. 

Most of her communities receive news through the [[Black Swan Tradesman]].

# Darkzone

The so-called coastal "**darkzone**" of Umazia is a place of vast industry and exploitation. It is called the darkzone for it is a place where going missing means "going dark", or vanishing altogether: a play on words given that the construct soldiers who keep Umazia in line patrol night and day to both protect and confine the populace.
