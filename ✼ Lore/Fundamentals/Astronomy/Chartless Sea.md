The **Chartless Sea**^[Known less commonly as the **Maelstrom**, the **Origin Point**, **Borderworld**, or **Brink**.], is the [malformed realm](https://2e.aonprd.com/Planes.aspx?ID=19) and origin place of [[Chaos]], in its rawest energetic form. It acts as the origin point of chaoskin, most notably [[protean|proteans]].

# Properties
Its physical form is tenuous, but resembles a sea of endless tar that is both ever-growing and ever-approaching from a viewer's perspective. 

The Chartless Sea is the source of universal expansion and thus the endlessness of the [[Out There|Outer Planes]]. Beings within this font of creation cannot easily influence the world that spills forth from it (what chaoskin derisively call the "Structure"). It probably also created [[Kibangan]], though many believe the two came into being in opposition to one another. 

Today, as [[Manifold Seas|the universe]] it birthed has continued to grow, its power has apparently waned. 

# History
When concerning [[the Planet]], the borderworld's discovery and the madness that emerged led to the [[War of Chaos]]. The Chartless Sea was also the supposed birthplace of both [[the Maker]] and [[the Unmaker]].
