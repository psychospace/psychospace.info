The **Royal Bladeworks** is an old three-tiered pagoda north of [[Waxtown]], settling around a complex with which it shares its name, is an ancient installation maintained over time, said to be one of the first forges wielded by [[Stoneshaper Ethel]] before he claimed that title. Ethel was not of [[High Sacred]], and thus constructed this place all on his own with his original remnant's architectural style in mind.

Originally a temple to a god of war, it now also acts as a forge and training ground for the [[Sacred Dragoon Force]], who watch the temple with eyes everywhere.

Leading the efforts to reuse it as a temple and training ground was [[Ridd of Chained-Earth]].
