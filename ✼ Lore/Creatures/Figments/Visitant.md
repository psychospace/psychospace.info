A **visitant** is an artificial [[figment]] crafted with only a fragment of a [[soul]], given the ability to think and to live by carving out the collective consciousness through direct injections of [[Vibe]]. 

Though they likely existed in various forms beforehand, the first visitants to go by that name were created in [[1250 PT]] by [[Ikabod Caruso]], using his [[Ikabod's surrogate soul|eponymous spell]]. The most well known visitants are those created of [[Linnaeus Dino]], including [[Lyrica]], [[Lithop]], [[Lacuna]], [[Lethal]], [[Lucent]], [[Locket]], and [[Pendant]].

The natural impetus behind creating a visitant is to understand the soul used to craft it, digging deeper into inner emotions, ancient history, and truths.

# Creation and persona

In order to complete its soul, time must pass and their young mind must mature, similar to how childbirth works. Until that point, they lie motionless with major brain activity, as if dreaming while asleep. However, certain magics, such as the [[Lifeblinding|mark of lifeblind]], binds a soul to another soul, allowing it to complete much faster at some cost.

Visitants still in this dream-like state are capable of reacting to trauma by suddenly instantiating the rest of their soul as the mind perceives it, should the soul come into danger. This rapidly completes the soul, allowing it to immediately think, move, and escape danger, but since this rushes the process, it causes later memory and perception issues and bleedthroughs in the visitant, deemed "aftershocks". This instantiation process is only activated by instinct, and is similar to the safety measures that many animals have when faced with adversity.

# Appearance and outlook
When a visitant completes their soul, regardless of speed, it is largely a matter of conjecture how the soul will appear. Some say that aspects of the soul cannot be alienated when their form is changed, causing the soul's fragments to take on or adapt the appearance of its original source. Other hypotheses state that because the process relies on instinct, it will only ever replicate the original soul, and that differences between visitants of the same being rely only on environmental differences.

An odd effect of a visitant is in its [[Soul bond|psychospacial relation]] to its "original" soul. When someone views a visitant, they are viewing a creature with fragment of another soul, and thus, similar to how the visitant's mind works, the external viewpoint will "[[Bias coagulation|fill in the gaps]]" in its understanding of a person, causing inconsistencies in perception. In other words, since someone is only viewing "part" of a soul, their appearances can vary wildly between those who see them.

Should an external viewer ever become emotionally and psychically closer to the original soul that fragment came from, the resemblance between that person and the visitant will begin to seem uncanny in retrospect, impossible to deny, similar to a twin sibling. However, should the person be distant and uncaring of the original, they will seem as different as two unrelated people. This means some may be caught off-guard by a visitant's appearance, being that they will physically resemble someone else, regardless of the current state of that person.

The extent to which the effects on perception manifest are unknown at present, but they do cause emotional duress, the external viewpoint sometimes being incapable of separating the original from the visitant in their memories.
