**Amakudari-no-Mikoto** was an [[Dragon#Astral|astral amethyst dragon]] who ruled over [[Ith'Paraan]] for the society's entire existence. 

It is the most likely origin of the [[Gift of Stars]], for it could [[Time travel|travel]] freely along the infinity of space through the "fixed [[worldline|line]]" that was its [[Epitome|lifespan]]. It taught the people of the Planet about its Gift, forming the bedrock of the society which aspired to construct the [[Void breaker|void breakers]] and pierce the greatness of [[Out There|Graciosa]].

Its hubris led to the fall of Ith'Paraan, and, some say, to the [[Os'Grun]] impact event, when [[Amakudari's phantom|the Promise]] was fulfilled.

# Etymology
Specifically, *Amakudari-no-Mikoto* was the name it received upon reaching [[The Planet]], its birthplace, for the last time. In [[Draconic]], its name means *Earthbound Exalted One*. 

It also has a name it is known as specifically as the manifestation during its travels among the stars, **Amazakisuishousekiju-no-Ookami**, which calls it the *Great Scholar God of Amethyst Who Split The Heavens*. Upon committing to teaching the world its Gift, the dragon forwent this name.
