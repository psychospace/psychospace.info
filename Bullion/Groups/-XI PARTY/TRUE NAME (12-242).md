**TRUE NAME**, specifically the **12th Polyp of 242, Vigilance**, is a [[Goloma]] psychic, and was a *polyp* of [[TRUE NAME (collective)|TRUE NAME]]. They were known especially for being revived by [[The Pitcher]].

# History
This body was born into the collective in [[1217 PT]], the twelfth *polyp* that year (hence its name). Gifted with [[Telepathy#Contact|touch telepathy]] and a natual scavenger, TRUE NAME was happy to again possess use of these abilities. The body met its end at the hands of a monster sometime around early [[1249 PT]].

The body was later revived by the Pitcher during the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]]. In this, this body was apparently disconnected from the subjectivity of TRUE NAME. This was unprecedented, and subsequently, 12-242 was branded an apostate by TRUE NAME, forcing them out into a world where they had very little connections, and a mind with far too much information for one head.

One of their contacts, [[Valerie Stout]], shared the bounty being offered by [[Julia Gutierrez|her housemate]] in the [[Daily Grind]] for evidence of the stranger, and shared that knowledge. Perhaps seeking an explanation for why their connection was severed, TRUE NAME set forth to pursue this bounty.

# Personality
They remain with only a small subset of their psionic talents, but with all experiences for the over 250 years they had experienced: though not all of it appears to be accessible. They remain introducing themselves as TRUE NAME, and ultimately desire to return to and take control of the collective which 12-242 asserts is rightfully theirs.
