The self-proclaimed "Monarch of Fortune", **Igor Chrysopteros Ingolstadt** is a [[hobgoblin]], brother to [[Hieron Dredge]] and [[Arthur Graywell]]. Diametrically opposed to both, he is best described as the wisest of the three, who always has a spot in his heart to break you before making you die quickly.

While many know Igor to be a cold-blooded killer, he is actually just playing his side very efficiently. If you can even speak to one of his associates, you may find yourself with a selection of high-grade magical weapons, items, and materials, although you won't be running up a single coin of debt to him without him getting his due, any way he can. Total information control comes with total economic control, and it is said that the attack on [[Drastic]] has been forcing his hands to get desperate.

In truth, Igor is one of the [[Trinity Seven]], the clan leaders of the [[Spider's Web]], leading the Cocoon Clan, and is arguably the smartest amongst them. Whenever he fights, he makes sure without fail that he has an escape route.

Igor was "slain" by Star of the North, but he was resurrected in a clone body.
