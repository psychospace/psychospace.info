**Chaos**^[Notably capitalized when referring to the being.], occasionally known as **the Remembered World**, is a primordial entity, taking the form of a source of energy and endless probability. Chaos is a fundamental piece of the [[logic]] of the [[universe]], originating from the [[Chartless Sea]].

Chaos “itself” is an entity in the loosest sense: a near-nonsensical system of disjointed [alters](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alter#English) and personalities which have agglomerated together over millions of years: each is an [[Echo|echo]] of the old world, making up modern day [[Soul|souls]]. One might say that Chaos, even incomprehensibly vast as it is, possesses a kind of “will”, to act as guardian over nature and custodian of all creation. 

# Chaos energy
The energies that make up the entity named Chaos are also termed **chaos**^[Notably sentence-cased when referring to the energy.]. Its fusion and redefinition creates [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]].

# History
At some point in the course of the old world, a primal magic-like force was discovered on the fringe of the world, and all who lived began to alter reality irrevocably and uncontrollably. This led to the [[Old world]]'s destruction and recreation.

In the wake of this, the force of primal chaos remained in the [[The Planet|new world]]. This force was equal in power to the more-controlled [[Magic]] that eventually came to exist alongside it.
