**Genies** are powerful [[Elemental creatures|elemental]] [[Whill|whills]] who are considered paragons of the [[Elemental energy|axiom]] they are drawn and bound to.

[[Magic|Magically]] noteworthy in that they easily master most mortal skills, djinni pervade almost all of [[The Heavens]], though have been bound to individual, small kingdoms throughout the planar stack by the events of [[The Gathering]]. Animosity towards the [[Divinity|gods]] pushes djinni towards their home powers of [[Chaos]], and behooves them to bring about changes, however minor, in mortal everyday life. 

Royal djinni possess many godlike qualities, including the ability to grant [[Wish|wishes]]. The terms of the pacts they have agreed to, as well as a general complacency with their roles in the world, forces them incapable of granting their own wishes, though they still twist the meaning of any wishes they "so benevolently" grant in a way that inevitably benefits them.

Due to their restrictions, most djinn which are able to grace the [[Wild Blue Yonder]] do so in limited respects, through vessels which act as prisons for their essence, and through [[Witchcraft|witches]] they sire.
