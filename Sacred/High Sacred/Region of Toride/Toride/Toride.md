The seat of power of the region, **Toride** is the site of an ancient [[Carapa Republic|Carapaean]] city, [[Y'viry]], and its castle, T'ryyd, from which the city and region gets its name. It is said to be one of the more ancient towns in [[High Sacred]], having been a spot inhabited as far back as the initial invasion by [[Plesio Falknjir|the Bandit King]]. Its architecture is like almost nothing else in Sacred, a merging of ancient forts and spinning windmills.

Constructed just south of the [[Fields of Twilight]] and the [[Kurjan Badlands]], it has found itself gathering a healthy monster-hunting community within its tall ancient walls. The strongest and best connected of the monster hunters is the groups amidst the *[[Hall of the Watch]]*.

South of it is the [[Pixina Woods]], where more outer-lying constructions of Y'viry are found.
