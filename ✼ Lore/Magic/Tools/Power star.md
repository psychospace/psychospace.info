>[!question|ttl-c bg-c-blue]  Not to be confused with a genuine [[star]].

A **power star** or "starman" is a glowing yellow five-pointed [[Mana|mana]] crystal, with twin cores of onyx resembling eyes. These stars often fall from the sky, rumored to be fragments of [[The Above|Abovian]] civilization. [[Plesio Falknjir]], founder of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]], chose the symbol of a star for the country after encountering a falling power star during the last night of his siege on the [[Drastic|Holy Port of Ace]]. 

The starman acts a single-use pure source of [[invincibility]], which lasts a short time before fading. Once used in this manner, it vanishes.

Alternatively, this item can be used as an arcane focus by placing it within a special apparatus, fulfilling some of the [[Tribute]] cost of spells. After being used in this way, it turns blue and translucent, and it can't be used in any way for a manner of hours. It returns to its yellow coloration when it is ready for use again.
