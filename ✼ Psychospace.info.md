**Welcome to the official wiki of [[The Heavens|the Heavens]], a high-magic fantasypunk[^huh?] universe, created by [January November](https://bsky.app/profile/blog.psychospace.info).**

> Myth and mirth fuel the societies of the [[Wild Blue Yonder]] on floating sky-islands known as [[Remnant|remnants]], whose [[Flipside|flipsides]] hold secrets, other worlds, and treasure beyond compare. 
> 
> [[Magic]] finds its source in [[Psychospace|psychospace]], a realm of the mind which overlays all [[Soul|living things]], where your very emotion and ingenuity can conjure the [[Elemental energy|elements]], give [[Visitant|face]] to thought, [[Eidolon|guard]] your people, and much much more. 
> 
> As [[Airship|airships]] carve through cloud and charter through [[skysea|oceans of air]], buzzing away on the remnants' surfaces is a changing world... and one always about to receive another wake-up call.

># What is this world?
>This world, **the Heavens**, was originally created by January November beginning in 2019 (AD, not [[Pinwheel Tempo|PT]]!) for [tabletop roleplaying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game). While it is still used for this, it is also used for other purposes, such as fiction.
>
>It was initially designed to be largely without a distinct genre so that many different stories can be told within it. It was inspired primarily by many video games, cartoons both East and West, and various artists, such as [nelnal](https://twitter.com/nelnalium), [juanmao](https://twitter.com/juanmao1997?lang=en), [klaufir](https://www.patreon.com/salieske), and others.
>
>## What is this website?
>**Psychospace.info** acts as the official [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) for the Heavens, maintained and written by its creator. It is always being updated and expanded to improve its coverage of the universe, as well as reveal things beyond the spoiler wall. Many people have [[✼ World Credits|contributed]] to this project over the years, and their work is represented here.

> You may also be interested in the many [[✼ Story Hub|stories]] told in this universe.

# What even IS psychospace?

[^huh?]:  "<b>High-magic</b>" — [[magic|magic]] is highly prevalent in the natural order of the setting. "**Fantasypunk**"  — the setting has a strong fusion of fantastical sword-and-[[sorcery]] elements alongside steampunk and dieselpunk late-19th-century aesthetics, tech, and sensibilities, without a clear delineation between the two. Think "most *Final Fantasy* settings" and you've got the right idea.
