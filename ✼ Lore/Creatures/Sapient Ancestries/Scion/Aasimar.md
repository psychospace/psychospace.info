**Aasimar** (*ays-ih-mer* or *ahs-ih-mar*) are a celestially-blooded #sapient heritage of planar [[Scion|scions]] who have connections to [[Divinity|gods]] aligned with good. The term does not define just one heritage. Instead, similar to [[Tiefling|tieflings]], aasimar may crop up in any bloodline where [[Angel|angels]] and their like have cavorted with mortals. 

# Origins
[[Evangel|Evangels]] were sapient creatures directly blessed by angels, and thus usually act as part of an aasimar's heritage.

# Traits
Though physically similar to their parents, they are often marked by slight deviations: a shiny skin, glowing eyes and features, feathers in their hair, or a musical voice. At the most extreme, aasimar might be born with infantile wings that grow with them into adolescence. 

At a baseline, aasimar will usually live about 2 to 3 decades longer than is typical for their ancestry, though many outlive this.

In somewhat rare cases, the *[[Fylgja|fylgja]]* of an aasimar is often represented by an *angelic guide*, an [[immortal]] icon that still exists in their marked blood.

# Culture
Aasimar are stereotyped as having a strong sense of beauty and grace, though many do not see the differences they might have from their peers, creating a sense of expectation and loneliness. 

In many places in [[The Heavens]], partly aasimar bloodlines hold positions of high renown, such as the monarchs of the [[Great Nortian Empire]] or [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. This does not mean that their presence is always appreciated though, as aasimar represent a tug towards a destiny: oftentimes one that necessitates placing them on a pedestal.

# Heritages
Several types of aasimar exist for the many types of celestials. These are often generalized based on their morality: *scourges* purge with an inner [[Light (property)|Light]] that can't be quenched, *fallen* aasimar seek redemption and a desire to leverage lost eons, and *protectors* often find themselves standing fast in danger when others might turn and run.
