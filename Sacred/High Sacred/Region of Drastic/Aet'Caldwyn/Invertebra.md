The **Invertebra** was the physical apparatus holding the planetbound pieces of of the [[Blackflame]], bound within the [[Cathedral of the Womb]]. 

Using the [[L'ipotesi|L'Ipotesi Manuscript]] and an angelic apparatus called the **Slingshot**, real beings could be translated inside of an [[Out There|unreal]] space, where the blackflame was intended to be shunted outside of all possible existence. When this failed to destroy the being, an [[Evangel]] of low-repute decided to watch over the flame for all eternity.

It was initially bound in a crystal diadem, but over time that prison melted.
