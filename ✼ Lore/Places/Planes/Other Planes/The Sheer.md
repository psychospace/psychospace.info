description: The Sheer is a demiplane of collapsed-space.
---
The **Sheer** ([[Oa'Rovi]]: *Rav'ithflas*, lit. "Portal of Tumult Fog"), also called **collapsed-space** or **dense-space**, is a [[Plane#Demiplane|demiplane]] projection of [[Kibangan]] as cast by the second-nearest star to [[The Planet|the planet]], [[Stronn]]. It is well known as a powerful aspect of nature commanded by the [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] [[Nortian imperial family|imperial line]] through [[Ekaitz]].

It is partly a creation of [[Chartless Sea]]. [[Psychospace]], due to being a shadow cast by [[Cien]], exists as a more prevalent projection of Kibangan, and so its magic overlays this one. 

The [[Runic engine|runic engine]] makes use of the Sheer, shortening distances through the skies.
# Etymology
The name "Sheer" came from its properties as a curtain of fog, as well as its thin, near-imperceptible presence. It is called "collapsed-space" because its size can be controlled by those who exert influence on it, and thus "collapses space" as a conduit between points in the [[universe]].

# Properties 
It manifests in a number of ways, but is usually used as a secure, shortened [[portal|conduit]] between several holy places of import, when normal teleportation may either be too dangerous or not dangerous enough. As such, the Sheer exhibits physical properties akin to the [[Wild Blue Yonder]].

## Definition
Its usual appearance is a land cloaked in eternal nightfall, with a single massive gray moon overlooking an endless deep blue sea of rainstorms, where the structures of the Sheer are found. Its architecture bears an aesthetic that defies the current era in the outside world.

Its form and structure is primarily defined by powerful entities and the power they inter in their followers: as such, those who summon a portal to the Sheer often unintentionally make it resemble places they are familiar with. For example, [[Puretza]], is known to hold "stake" in the realm. It is also believed that a connection to the Sheer maintains the [[Dustwall]] around [[Yofora]], connected by [[Uforia]].

## Wildcat destabilization
When a truly destructive Sheer portal destabilization occurs, termed a *wildcat destabilization* after the uncontrolled aggression of the process, a [[Ghost storm|ghost storm]] is created instead of a Sheer conduit, as [[Vibe]] is pulled from [[Psychospace]] through the Sheer. [[Heartknock]] created ghost storms through this process, leveraging half-finished runic engines for the task.
