Mother of [[Eldral Levin]]. [[Godwin Levin]]'s wife and the business mind behind [[The Horseshoe]].

She was born and raised in [[Osprey Bay]]. She is a merchant's daughter who was originally going to be a housewife. She met Godwin after she snuck away to a tavern he was working in. They have been married for 32 years. She loves all her children and wants what's best for them, but can be a little overbearing. She is slow to anger but is quite scary when her temper gets the best of her. She keeps trying to get [[Selah Levin]] and [[Alexander Levin]] to get married.

Annette is 55.
