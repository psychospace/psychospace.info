A **phantasm** is a [[Confluence|conflux]] in [[psychospace]] which effects distorted [[gravity]], named because the point is believed to be a "threshold" by the people around that point. This forms either a one-way or two-way point to the [[Flipside|other side]] of a [[remnant]]. These are powerful, well-respected and tended sites, which, given great respect, have strength.

The vast majority of phantasms are temporary. Any which are more permanent are that way through tradition, such as through religious significance, lingering emotions, or other sources.

Phantasms are actually small points where [[Kibangan]] more clearly manifests in the [[Wild Blue Yonder]], allowing gravity to shift due to the influence of psychospace. 

# Mirage
The most powerful and potent phantasms can cover entire cities in their crossing point. These grander places are known as **mirages** or **oasises**, as they often take up large pieces of the environment and make them identical to their [[Flipside]] in nature. 

[[The Well]] in [[High Sacred]] is one such place.
