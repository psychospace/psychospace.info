A magical material, **orichalcum** is said to be the distilled form of [[Time|time]]. It's a type of [[Mana|Mana]]. It is said that the [[Divinity|gods]] wield weapons made of this material, as though it were a crystalline form of nature.

Impurities in orichalcum can form the material [[Chronolite]].
  
This manifests in places where [[Gravity]] has been significantly altered, such as caverns that become [[Phantasm|phantasms]].
