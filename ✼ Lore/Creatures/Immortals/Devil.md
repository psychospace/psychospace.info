A **devil** is a member of a family of [[Fiend|fiends]] from the obverse sides of the [[Scarlet Skies]], or, more broadly, the Hells. Devils are charged to provide a negative counterbalance to the unchecked spread of [[Soul|souls]] -- specifically, the spread of [[Light (property)#Darkness|Darkness]] in mortal [[psychospace]] --and are driven to feed these ambitions and protect their interests.

Devils are usually lawful evil, and typically field abilities useful when harrying escape attempts from the wandering damned, such as [[telepathy]], darkvision, or blood magic. Their divine overseer is [[Roced]].

# Culture
Devils possess an infinite animosity towards [[Demon|demons]], fed and satiated only by proxy-warring with them. Unlike demons, devils possess a potentious ability to influence the living, and wield this power maliciously (by offering deals and "improvements in afterlife care"). A devil's word, unlike a [[genie]]'s, is always cloaked in subtext and unspoken clauses which ultimately color any attempt to bargain with them.

Through this, they foster gain for themselves, and ensure that [[Death|dead]] souls do not escape their cities until punishment is sated. Though they were charged with acting as a negative force, they do ultimately seek to become god-kings of their own enterprises, and have made occasionally audacious plays for power in other layers. 

Just like demons, however, devils are not driven to work together, unless mutually benefitting from an arrangement: for example, as vassals of a greater devil, or of potential for climbing up a hierarchy. As such, their complexities have led to markets built on capitalism and greed. 

The most powerful devils, known as archdevils, are master manipulators and some of the most fearsome beings across the entire Planet. You might never know you're acting under their contract until you are already dead. Some have schemes so complex and long-reaching that, it is said, they may be replaced mid-scheme by a different devil, who undertakes the same name and abilities as the one they toppled: a twist and contingency fully planned by the original.
