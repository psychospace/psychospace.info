**Narayan Arkwright** is a noble [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Emirati]] [[gnome|gnomish]] emir of [[House Arkwright]], the younger brother of [[Khasan Arkwright]]. In recent years, Narayan has been put in charge of the [[Arkwright Improvement Company]], overseeing from on-high much of the restoration efforts of the remnant following the [[Great Hurricane]].

A well-known womanizer, Narayan has had five wives over the course of his two-century life so far, none of whom lasted longer than a decade. Apparently, he is not an abuser: simply, he is too self-centered to reach out, and his partners, typically dating [for financial gain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_dating) initially, seek more emotional attachment than he seems capable of giving. This repeated failure at love, yet his penchant to seek it anyway, has led to him acquiring a bit of a sour name, even among those more unpopular members of his house.

He has had several children, the most notable of which was [[Gaiseric Arkwright]], a half-gnome man who was famously murdered by his wife in [[1268 PT]], in a fit of what was called by the press at the time "paranoid madness".
