The **plague of petals** was a viral sickness which once spread across [[The Heavens]] in the form of a [[curse]]. 

It would devour both unrequited and invigorating love and turn those suffering from it into plant-like hybrids, eventually poisoning and killing them. A trademark of the plague was the appearance of pink petals hacked up from the throat, hence the name.
