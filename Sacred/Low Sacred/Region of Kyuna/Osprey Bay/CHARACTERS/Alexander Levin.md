**Alexander Levin**, known as "Al" to his friends, is the oldest son of the Levin Family, brother to [[Eldral Levin]].

Growing up, he was very social and energetic. He tried many things before becoming a weaver and going into business with his dwarf friend [[Ralaec Grayhorn]]. Now Alexander is known by many for making durable, yet stylish carpets that stand the test of time.

He fancies himself a ladies man but had comically little luck until he met his current girlfriend of 2 years, the half-elf [[Gifria Enjyre]]. Alexander has tasked [[Eldral Levin]] with finding a suitable engagement ring for his girlfriend. Has a pet rabbit named [[Fluffers]] who always seems to be escaping.

Al is 29.
