**Zizz** is a [[Umazia|Umazian]] [[Changeling]] who was allied with the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], and a member of [[Special Task Force Undergarden]].

Her psychological profile is a complete blank, which for changelings means either bad things (doppelganger retrogression) or REALLY bad things (full regression into a [[Wegbrechen]]).

Like all of the Conspirators, Zizz normally wears the [[Cloak of Excelsio]].

She uses the Parting Shot, an experimental firearm tricked out with crystals and gemstones to magnify kinetic force through teleporting the bullet and target through [[The Sheer]].
