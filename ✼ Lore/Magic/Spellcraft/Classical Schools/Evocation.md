**Evocation** is the [[Magic]] study of **evokers**, and is one of the eight [[Classical Schools]] of magic, interlinked with [[Enchantment|Enchantment]]. Evocation is the study of the  recitation and translation of the [[Golden Voice]]; in other words, it is the study of the way in which the [[Divine Equation]] was written to bring about and call on aspects of both natural and supernatural worlds arbitrarily, especially aspects of [[Elemental energy|elemental chaos]]. 

Evocation is the first and remains one of the most fundamental theories of magic, as the spell [[Wish]] demonstrates. Because evokers essentially speak with the same authoritative nature as the very gods, it is also called the "study of creation".
