**Karyos** is the capital city of [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|the Protectorate]], also called the [[Bullion#Miracle City|Miracle City]] of the Golden Mount. 

# Description
A storied city at a lonely position in the large taiga of the [[Dahur Valley]], it is protected on all sides by rising, carved mountains of [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Reyezuela]]. Karyos has the idiosyncratic look of appearing old and well-preserved, yet at the bleeding edge of science and magic. 

The whole town, and the faultless confidence of her people, stands as a memorial to the peace that came after the [[Bullion Civil War]], with most buildings left standing from that time with scorch marks, arrow holes, and damaged signs prominently preserved.
## Government
Its city council is, like the city itself, largely beholden to the interests of the [[Alect Commissioner]].

As of [[1285 PT]], its current commissioner is [[Margaryda Archegon]].

# History
The eastern districts of the city date back to around the turn of the [[Bullion#Fourth Era|Fourth Era]], when [[Crista Dahur]]'s staff constructed a small town at the foot of her estate in order to coordinate with [[Mezcoatl]] missionaries. As the estate fell into disrepair amid Dahur's obsessions, the town grew in prominence, though evidently when Dahur entirely transformed, most of the town was abandoned.

Later Most of the modern city of Karyos was initially planned as an extension of its [[Fifth Institute|Conservatory]] under the will of its first commissioner [[Calyann Manteia]].

Around the time it was in the process of being planned, the [[Bullion Civil War]] scored the region with open wounds as magician turned on magician, turning the dirt to mulch and deepening a crater into the valley.


# Etymology
"Karyos" was a term originally used for an ancient tribe which once dwelled in [[Reyezuela]], whose presence has been noticed in the Dahur Valley. The Kary were an off-shoot of the [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] peoples who manipulated the [[Weather]] to protect them and ruminate on the stars. It is believed that the term itself comes from a [[Oa'Rovi|Auran]] term of honor for a [[sylph]].

Its epithet is owed

The [[Shindani]] demonym is "Kary".
