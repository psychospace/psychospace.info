A **whosit** classifies any [[Creature]] with an animated [[Body]] that does not have a [[Soul]] to its name. Oft created by [[Spell|spells]], these forms can be whole or in part. For example, an [[unseen servant]] is a whosit.

Both whosits and [[Whatsit|whatsits]] can be created in isolation using [[Vibe]], but this is not a cheap process, and isn't the natural process by which these sorts of things are made.

As an example, artificial whosits, in the form of duplicrows, make up the corps of the harpy couriers used by the [[Tower of Electron]].
