**Raghain** (*"rag-hen"*), the [[Bullion#Miracle City|Miracle City]] of the World Twice-Dead, is a breakaway state to the south of [[Bullion]] which has more or less made peace with the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]] as long as they're allowed to govern themselves.

Following the [[War of the Masters]], this state was formed when land was ceded to a revolutionary. It is overseen primarily by the [[Standard-Bearers]], a council of knights sworn to various lords in the region.

It's a member of [[The Shibboleth]].
