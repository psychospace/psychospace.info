***Uzia calora***^[Meaning "heat of the burning soul" in [[Arckan]].] (*oos-shah call-ohr-ah*), also known as the **calore plague**, was a mythic illness which made a person's [[Fylgja|fylgjur]] begin to grow indistinct with their own [[Body|bodies]]. It took [[Seiu]]'s wisdom to understand that this "indistinction" was a blessing, which gave rise to shapechangers and [[kitsune|kitsune]] specifically.

There have been no known modern instances of *uzia calora*, so its very existence is conjectural.

Apparently, this caused the [[First Magicians|First Ones]] afflicted so to become sterile. Seiu, "fox-possessed", came to these conclusions through understanding the affliction: the gods had spread this affliction in order to ultimately bring prosperity throughout the land, part of the [[Divinity|divine]]'s watch over the progress of new life. 

Seiu further preached that this affliction had not sterilized her, but that any who thought they were had simply not fixed their shape in a way they were comfortable with.

In all the others that caught this affliction, they gained an inkling for mutability, something that later sprouted into [[Elf|elven]] abilities of sexlessness and [[Changeling#Medial changeling|medial]] abilities of shapelessness. It was only because of Seiu that the First Ones were able to learn how to make use of this ability.
