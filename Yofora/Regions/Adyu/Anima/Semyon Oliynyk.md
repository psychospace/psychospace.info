Prince **Semyon Oliynyk** is a [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] noble from the [[Adyu Islands]] who is father to [[Leonid Nortia]] and [[Lidiya Nortia]].

He was an arcane advisor/teacher to [[Bianca Nortia]], and longtime family friend. By his twins going to the [[University of Anima]], itâ€™s almost the polite way of just sending them back to him, after a controversy involving rightful heirship.
