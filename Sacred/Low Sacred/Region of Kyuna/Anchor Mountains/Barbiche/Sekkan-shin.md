**Sekkan-shin** (雪冠神) is a mighty ancient silver [[dragon|dragon]] who lives atop [[Snowcrown Mountain]], which is named for him. His blood has been passed down over and over by the Champion of [[Barbiche]].

He is more formally known as **Yukikanmuri-no-Kami**, the *kun'yomi* pronunciation of his name.


# History
![[⎋ Needs Rewrite]]
His first iteration was known as **Hosuseri**, child of [[Sakuya and Ninigi]].

Before [[Kessah]], Sekkan-shin only served as a guide and a mentor to past Champions, often from within his home at the top of the mountain. But with Kessah, he was also a friend. Not many of the previous champions even saw Sekkan-shin’s true form in their lifetime. Again, he would pop in on the village during festivals and other such occasions, and mostly tried to maintain a formal act, though sometimes he would play tricks on the villagers every now and then: sometimes for fun, sometimes out of boredom.

Growing up, Kessah would occasionally get a small voice of encouragement when she’d begun to practice her arcane abilities. It wasn’t until she went up to give the dragon his yearly offering in her 16th year that the two developed a kinship of sorts. It is around this time that Sekkan-shin first had a sense that Kessah’s real training should begin, reminding her of her duty and the importance she holds in the future of the country. Kessah studied more then, finally feeling a real sense of importance rather than an entitled one. 

Though he said little to her at first, Kessah tried to talk to Sekkan-shin, very casually and often very pushy in trying to get a conversation out of the ancient dragon. The more she trained, the more she and Sekkan-shin grew familiar. Casual. To the point where she often forgot just how strong and powerful and intimidating the silver dragon really was. He was usually in a different form when he appeared to her anyhow.
