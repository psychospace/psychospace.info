**Noemite**^[Pronounced [no-ehm-ight], or [nohm-ight], depending on accent] is a precious metal which possesses unique resonant qualities. 

A tough material which must be worked at high temperatures, it is most well known for its utility in creating [[Verlan|verlanic]] energy, as it forms the basic component of typical [[dust tunnel|dust tunnels]]. 

As a commodity, noemite and noemite mining has grown in importance as leytech has become more lucrative.

# Mining

Noemite veins is predominantly sourced from the [[V채r채h]], where it is plentiful, following its [[Zero Day|reemergence]]. Cubic veins of noemite can be found throughout the planet in lower quantities, as well as have been regularly found in [[the Below]] for centuries.

Mining noemite is considered extremely difficult when compared to other minerals, due to the necessity of [[Airship#Supraekeic|supraekeic airships]] to survive regular changes in pressure caused by such a journey.

# Physical properties

In its pure form, it occurs in distinctive [cubic-crystalline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system) structures, resembling [pyrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrite). 

When worked in metallurgy, noemite is resistant to [annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(materials_science)), and the edges of its cubic crystals typically remain as distinct square "flows" upon the surface of the material, even after its symmetries have been reworked multiple times.

Individual nodes of noemite harbor the ability to sustain a personal, [[Psionics|psychokinetic]], [[Gravity|gravitational]] field, which allows them to hover in arrangement when suffused by the shape of the ambient [[phoreus field]]. Individual nodes are also able to alter their alignment and fixed-height in accordance with directed [[Off-wave|off-waves]] in its environment.

Noemite's most noteworthy properties arise from its interaction with [[Echo|echoes]], which attune and adhere to the metal. Echoes can be transported using noemite as a medium, via physical resonance (usually through contact and vibrations) in other nodes. These properties form the extreme basis of its ability to transmit [[verlan]].

# Alloys
## Emanite 
A [teflon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene)-like polymer-alloy of noemite made with [zinc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc) (10%-8%), [silicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon) (5%-3%), and other optional additives including, [bismuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth), [copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper), [silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver), [gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold), [platinum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum), and [uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium). The most commonly used mixture is Proper Emanite, containing zinc, silicon, and gold. It has a high [plastic deformation point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticity_(physics)) and can sustain a lot of elastic deformation. This provides a juxtaposition of a soft, plastic like material that is also cold to the touch due to its good thermal conductivity. 
## Diestermite
A noemite-[lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium) alloy developed by [[Diesterthan Materials]]. The alloy consists of around 95%-99% noemite to 4%-0.5% lithium respectively. It is far softer and ductile than raw noemite. Wires made from diestermite are used to provide a continuous physical conduit of psionic energy. Wires made in this way have an additional addition of ?? to prevent [[#Sliation]]. 
### Sliation
Diestermite deteriorates over a few months to a year after fully cooling in a process called Sliation. The lithium in the alloy creeps its way out of solution and onto the surface of the metal. This forms an outer plating of lithium encasing a pure noemite core. This process can be accelerated down to a few days by exposing it to heat or psionic energy for the duration. 
This phenomenon can be used to create a solid shaped piece of noemite, as noemite in its pure state is hard and resists annealing. The alloy is created, cooled to a workable temperature, then shaped into its desired form. After accellerating the sliation, the outer layer of lithium can be removed through washing and/or scraping. 
[Lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead) can be added as an additive with a mass of around 1.5%-1% of the alloy to prevent Sliation. This marginally decreases the alloy's conductivity while dramatically increasing its lifetime, up to the order of decades.
##  Paste
A noemite-[mercury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)) [amalgam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgam_(chemistry)) with a mass distribution of 85% to 15% respectively. It is primarily used as a plaster for filling psircuit traces for small-scale [[Verlan||verlan]] systems.
