In the context of [[Magic|magic]], an **antique** or **artifact** is a special type of magical item or [[creature]] that has had a prolonged [[Epitome|existence-span]] or has been particularly venerated when a severe moment in history arises, and has gained or accrued additional magical properties as a result. 

In [[Draconic]], the concept is called a **tsukumogami** (lit. "tool *kami*"), and is described as item which has acquired a spirit through veneration and preservation. Usually, this effect occurs over the course of about a century. The most powerful antiques are usually also [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]].

Such effects are the result of multiple generations of [[Psychospace|psychospacial]] influence.

# False antiques
A so-called **false antique** is an object whose existence has been artificially and retroactively (through [[Discrepant|discrepancy]]) lengthened, usually through [[New Magic]], in order to grant it the properties of an antique. 

From the perspective of the present day, such objects have been a part of history for an extended period, but only artificially so. The creation of a false antique produces a monumental [[Context|chiral incongruity]] with reality, dangerous if nothing else, which can be observed and repaired if its development is caught early enough.

This is primarily accomplished through [[reality-bending]]. False antiques as a factor or threat in magic have only come to the attention of casters in the last century (circa [[1285 PT]]), and the true method of their creation is entirely unknown.
