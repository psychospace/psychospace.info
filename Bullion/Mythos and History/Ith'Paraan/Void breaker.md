**Void breakers** were [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] [[Airship|airships]] that could traverse the [[Antic Sea]] and [[Out There|beyond]], supposedly as easily as it could traverse the [[Wild Blue Yonder]]. They used some form of [[Witchcraft|witchcraft]]-based [[Core engine|core engine]] to effect this. A crewmate aboard a void breaker would be known as a *void farer*. It was engineered by Ith'Paraan's [[starchitect]].

Though some have been unearthed from the time, they no longer function, due to the realignment of the spheres caused by the [[Os'Grun]] impact event. Under the [[Viewpoint property|viewpoint property]], the position they were created from no longer exists as it once did.
