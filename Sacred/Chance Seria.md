**Chance Seria** was a transgender [[Blood-hunter|blood-huntress]] that now exists in the [[Soul]] of [[Buttons and Snooze]]. She worshipped the [[Lavastus|Lost Hunter]].

She sought to uncover the path to a mystical transformation into "the trapped selves" in her pursuit of mutagens and alterations to her body. Perhaps disillusioned in this pursuit, she accidentally awoke her anima and animus as twin consciousnesses in the same body using the [[Mutagen of Absolute Self]], causing a bisection of her soul in the pursuit of reincarnation. This is why the twins share memories but have different psyches, and why their body is wired incorrectly. In a way, she succeeded.
