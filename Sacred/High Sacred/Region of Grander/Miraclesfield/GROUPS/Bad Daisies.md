The **Bad Daisies** are an alliance of poets and muses who are said to have originally joined forces during the time of the [[Plague of petals]] in hopes of finding solidarity. It was originally founded by a coalition of nobles who had lost their fortune and social stature to the ongoing tragedy. In modern times, they act as community watchdogs, as well as an artistic movement, hoping to elevate [[Miraclesfield]] to its own namesake.

To some, they are something of a nuisance, willing to play with the bounds of the law, or even outside of statutes protecting adventuring ilk, in order to protect the people around them. The Daisies, however, believe they exist in part to highlight the hypocrisy in defending the law without a willingness to break unjust laws.

They are lorded over by [[Hester Vandal]], who holds the rank and title of Queen Fullbloom. The BD's operate out of the [[Suntower Theater]]. Among their rank was once [[Lyrica]].
