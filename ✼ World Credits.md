# Players *(alphabetically sorted)*

## Pre-MMT
Multiple characters originated from before the world itself existed. Credit is owed to all of the players of *Graffiti & Golems*, who inspired the characters, stories, and backstories of [[Critical Hit]].

Credit is also owed to the people who played in *Glory to Nascia*, who inspired [[The Unfortunate]], and the people who bore with me in *Flight of the Knife*, who inspired [[Special Task Force Undergarden]].

Had I never had each of those experiences, I would not be the writer I am today. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
