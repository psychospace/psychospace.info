In discussions of [[magic]], an **epitome** of a thing is its "existence span", as if it were a linear string that could be lengthened, cut shorter, or moved along the [[worldline|worldline]]. An epitome generally has multiple similarities to the concept of a lifespan, but is a broader concept.

This 'string' can be manipulated by the influence of magic, especially [[Reality-Bending|reality-bends]] to be paused, moved, and resumed again from either an earlier or later point. The length of an epitome is largely static: only its position might be moved. [[Healing]] and [[Resurrection]] magic both involve the extension or restoration of a terminated epitome.

When discussing complex magic and specifically [[New Magic|new-magic]], especially in discussion of [[Antique|antiques]] and [[Discrepant|discrepants]], it became necessary to describe things in a means that accounts for [retrocausality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocausality_)[^1]. Thus, the term "*epitome*" was co-opted from a literary sense to describe this phenomenon: a summary of a being's "story".

## Example
[[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]] was able to traverse its own epitome, perceiving the world at any point along its own lifespan, as part of its travels into infinity with its [[Gift of Stars|Gift]]. This was at a limited capacity, as it would still age linearly. When challenged by its own hubris, it fulfilled [[Amakudari's phantom|the Promise]] by moving its limited epitome backwards to warn itself.
