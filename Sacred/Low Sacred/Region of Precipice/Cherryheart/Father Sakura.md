A massive tree in the [[Giant Forest]] which acts as it's defender. Its heart, the [[Heart of the Woods]], acts as its power source, and grew through the ground of [[the Beastlands]] before forming its own protective seal in the form of the tree.

Using its magic, reverse that of the [[Tree of Time]] on the [[Flipside]], it maintains a protective seal of time over the Giant Forest, preventing things from growing too wildly. It was disrupted by the [[Ghost storm|purple storm]] causing it to change "holy" status to that of defending the past, letting down its guard in the present.

However, it was then healed by the Prince and Star working together.
