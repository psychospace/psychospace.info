The **Nortian imperial family** is a noble family of [[human]] [[aasimar]] which [[Empress of Nortia|rules by right]] over the [[Great Nortian Empire]], and has for its entire modern existence. Also termed **House Nortia**, the imperial lineage and its vassals help protect and govern the extents of her remnants using their abilities of [[monism]], and serve an important ecclesiastical role in the [[Temple of the Uforiad]].

Claimed as **descendants of gods**, the family began with [[Valerian]] Nortia, Dream of Wanderlust and a direct personage of [[Uforia]], followed by its daughter [[Svetlana Nortia]], the first empress. 

As of [[1285 PT]], the current matriarch of the family, and empress, is [[Serena Nortia]], and her [[Successor (Nortia)|Successor]] is her brother, [[Iosif Nortia]]. ^b1d097

# Horizon Walker
The [[swordschool]] of the Nortian imperial line is known in [[Shindani]] as **horizon walking**. It is a complex form of combat involving use of [[magic]] to eliminate extraordinary enemies, considered a national treasure. It shares many properties with the rites of [[bladesong]], and its study also differs between members of the Nortian line and others, due to the family possessing an uneven [[Logic#Guidance of logic|affinity]] for [[the Sheer]].  ^0f7bd1

Horizon walking was developed initially as a school of thought based on controlling the [[Dustwall]], built out of religious piety and zealotry for the empire, and used first during warfare in the conquering of [[Umazia]]. Horizon walkers are traditionally masters of axes and crossbows; post-war, this has evolved into a mastery of [[Firearm|firearms]], in particular [[Firearm#Rifle-axes|rifle-axes]]. Its present pinnacle form, following these new developments, is the rifle-axe [[Homecoming]].

Horizon walking involves largely leveraging the Sheer's control over [[weather]] and creation of [[Portal|portals]] in order to manipulate the environment to one's advantage. On a tactical scale, a master horizon walker can summon cold fronts to push entrenched foes out, cloud their army's approach with a blanket of fog, and alter the barometric pressure to deafen or cripple a camp of enemies. On a single-fighter scale, a horizon walker can use weapons others cannot, disable machines, create angles of attack by regularly stepping small distances through the Sheer before and after making incisions with axes. and manipulating forces of electricity to permanently incapacitate enemies.
