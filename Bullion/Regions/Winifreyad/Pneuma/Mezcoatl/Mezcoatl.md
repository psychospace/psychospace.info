**Mezcoatl**, the [[Bullion#Miracle City|Miracle City]] of the Whispering Thicket, is a major city which marks the border between [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Winifreyad]] and the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]] in [[Bullion]].

Held in the cradle of nature, a community of artists and students run a bit of a funky tourist-trap, painted in broad strokes with a culture of respect and agency. For those traveling to the famed hot-springs, or to the still-kept shrines from the [[Bullion#Third Era|third era of Bullion]], the reason behind the community's new reverence for nature is clear to those who listen well to the long-lived folk who still recall the [[Bullion Civil War|civil war]]. Those who listen close might still hear the cry of gnomish groundbreaker constructs from the dense labyrinth underfoot, from when the Reyezuela mountains were bled open to feed the conflict.
