About two miles northeast of [[Gateway]] is **Krydda**, an ancient fortress constructed by the native people of [[Low Sacred]].

It is now infested with [[Kuo-toa]], making the state of its existence almost unknowable. Sleeping within about a mile of the fort causes all dreams to be shared.

The fort's guardian deity, a [[tlincalli]]-like entity named Micklepie, offers to defend the fort should anybody unwary approach with their weapons drawn.
