**Wild magic** defies physical explanation much more erratically than standard magic. When [[Magic]] overcharges or is abused, or the interaction between source and [[Spell|spell]] is so close that one must draw on the other, that magic is said to go "wild", paying intense [[Tribute|tributes]] for the trouble.  

Unchecked, exposure to it results in innumerable side effects, but certain [[sorcery|sorcerers]] have gained a shield on their soul with wild magic, and use it as a field of study and growth. These sorcerers still receive surges of the power of this force of nature, but they have found that the benefits of "breaking the rules" as it were often outweigh the occasional self-*fireball*.

Wild magic, tied closely to life essence, is the source of certain magical techniques which have been marked [[Magic#Black magic|forbidden]] by most scholars, for they alter the forces of magic or soul too much to be considered safe.

Examples of such techniques and aspects include
- [[Cruel spells]], which overcharges magic and dry up [[Psychospace]] for a time.
- [[Lifeblinding]], which results in a spell's duration extending by aging the bonded caster.
- "Darkcasting", which results in a spell's power being enhanced by exploiting the ties between dream, psychospace, and pain, effectively leveraging all three to bring forth something that shouldn't be.

[[New magic]] often skirts around the definitions of wild magic, but it is dangerous in many of the same ways, and is ridiculed and warned against for that. Specifically, the act of [[Reality-Bending|altering reality]] through force causes an *overlay event*, which is something also incurred by darkcasting. The subsequent [[Altercation|reaction by reality]] is often enough to dissuade the practice.
