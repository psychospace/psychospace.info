description: On the Ides of Alssad, 1283 PT, both Aloysius and Mariella were killed, their kid daughter vanished, and the property was burnt to the ground by Nullius, leaving nothing behind.
---

The [[Tuck family farm]] **burned to the ground** on the night of the Ides of Alssad, [[1283 PT]], resulting in the deaths or vanishings of its owners -- [[Aloysius Tuck|Aloysius]], [[Mariella Tuck|Mariella]], and [[Pollyanna Tuck]] --  as well as [[Johanna Abascal]]. Prior to the burning, [[Pietro Whitaker]], a confidant of young Abascal, was also murdered.

The individual known as the [[Thousand Rider]] is believed to be at fault, though reasoning for the attack remain publicly unknown, and evidence is scarce. The Rider, as a result, has grown to become infamous throughout [[the Shibboleth]].

# Event
![[⎋ Uncommon#^1bfe2a]]
## Fifth to Ides
[[Sandalio Vela]] and his daughter [[Johanna Abascal]] arrived at [[Aloysius Tuck|Aloysius]] and [[Mariella Tuck]]'s [[Tuck family farm|farm]][^1], to assist in their getting ready for the summer planting season. This is also an opportunity for Johanna to relax after many supernatural encounters. Before departing, [[Pietro Whitaker|Pete]], her confidant, advised her towards this course of action, as spending a long time away from lots of people might ease her mind.
## Ides
* In [[Lylesberg]], [[Pietro Whitaker]] is taken hostage by the [[Thousand Rider]], who is still hunting for the host of the *[[Mournful Cry|Mournful Cry]]*. Though it is still unknown why, he betrays Johanna's location. 
	* When the Rider is pursued by lawmen, she shreds and kills Pietro in revenge, and then speeds off on [[Thousand Rider#Thousand Bike|her bike]].
* At night on the [[Tuck family farm]], dinner is disturbed by the arrival of the Rider, looking for Johanna. [[Sandalio Vela|Dalio]] tries to intercede, but is shaken by Pete's death and misses the knight with his blastrifle, resulting in a grievous^[what might've been fatal, if not for the captain's [[Beastkin]] nature] wound to the stomach. 
	* To try and prevent her approach, [[Pollyanna Tuck|Pollyanna]] and Johanna set fire to the farmhouse. However, the Rider works around this, killing Aloysius and Mariella to extinguish the flames, attempting to get Johanna to submit. 
	* As the two are chased into the attic,[^2] Johanna attempts to [[Reality-Bending|bend reality]] and rescue the two of them, rewinding the last moment before they're both killed. This improbability results in a [[collapse state]], and everything in the vicinity vanishes: Johanna, Polly, Chonrima, the bodies of Aloysius and Mariella, and the farmhouse.
* Elsewhere, the same night, [[Hannah Corlett|Johanna Louise Corlett]] is to meet a noble son for a romantic tryst, when she and him notice the burning farmhouse.

## Eighteen to Kalends
Johanna Abascal awakens[^2] outside of where the house ought to be, having survived her own [[Altercation]] but without any clue where Pollyanna is. She revives her father with her magic before using the *Mournful Cry* to escape.

# Effects

Only one survivor is known: [[Sandalio Vela]], Johanna's father, as well as a witness, now-missing teenager [[Hannah Corlett]]. Sandalio attested to press at the time that his daughter had escaped after saving his life, though no physical trace of the house, let alone Johanna, is known to have survived the events. 

Information relating to this mysterious incident has been continually sought by [[Sganyodaiyo]] agents.
