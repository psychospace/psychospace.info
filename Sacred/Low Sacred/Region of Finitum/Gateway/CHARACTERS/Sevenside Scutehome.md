Jon Boy "Sevenside" Scutehome is the fight promoter at [[The Money Pit]].

An old bard gnome, so nicknamed for his eight-sided die which only counts to 7 (with two 1s), contenders have to pay him 25 gp in order to enter, but he's got a soft spot for those who look promising. High class folk, that is.
