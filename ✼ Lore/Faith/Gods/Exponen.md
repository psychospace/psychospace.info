Also called "The Fate Idol", **Exponen** is a [[Divinity|deity]] whose [[domain]] is [[Psychospace]], the future, and potentiality, representing all [[Figment|figments]], is the patron god especially of [[Eidolon|eidolons]]. 

They are worshipped as a deity of protection and of natural passage, overseeing the [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]] that carry the [[Death|dead]]; in that rite, they are often called **Nexos**, and they hold dominion over the Hell of [[Unwri]]. Exponen has no set gender, and is often depicted as a massive eidolon.
# History

No god can count a time before Exponen's birth, not even its parentage, for the future can be said to give the passage of time weight and meaning.

A child of [[Athemat]] and [[Cientia]], Exponen was supposedly stillborn. Apparently never truly existing as a "full member" of the divinity, despite not "yet" being born, it could be said that Exponen's domains, as a god of psychospace, allows her to remain existing as a god in pure ideal form.

Its fated rival was to be a [[Arizhmiya|deity of the past]]. However, it also combats those who would limit the potentials of psychospace, such as [[Eoremu]]. It is often allied with deities such as the [[Cat Lord]], who possess the ethereal sight to see their potentiality.
