The **Divine Equation** is a theoretically-infinite, inconceivable equation that governs and oversees all rules of reality as it exists in [[The Heavens]]. Though it is widely known as the Divine Equation, it also shares properties with adjacent concepts, such as algorithms and programs. The important understanding is that the Equation is the arbiter distinguishing between all necessary potentiality and possibility for the universe. It is written in the [[Golden Voice]] of its authors, the [[Divinity]]. 

Its base element is the force called [[Logic]]. %%The limits of the Equation are kept in check by the [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]]. %%All [[Magic]] falls under its guidelines.

It is impossible for any mortal to fully [[psychic code|comprehend]] any meaningfully-lengthy tract of the equation. Thus, magic is an attempt to access its natural laws *ad-hoc*, and thus affect reality. %%Until the advent of [[Psion|psions]], %%The natural conclusion of this is represented by the [[Wish]] spell.

Like degrees and radians in the real world, the measurements by which each faith or school of magic generally wield the Equation vary by 'unit': for the goddess [[Cientia]], for example, this unit would be “time”, as this is her [[domain]]. 

The only creatures that can fathom all of the infinite Equation are, in essence, the [[Divinity|gods]] who created them in the first place.
