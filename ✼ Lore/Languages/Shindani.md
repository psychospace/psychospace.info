**Shindani**, better known as **Common**, is a widespread family of languages which originated from [[Dawndust]], also known as *Laycant* for its use in trans-species sermons. Around two-thirds of the literate population of [[the Planet]] can speak some variant of Shindani; the language can easily be called the *lingua franca* of [[the Heavens]].

Written Shindani adapts several different scripts originally used to write [[Celestial language|Celestial]], and its writing rules follow many difficult-to-learn conventions.

# History
Gradually developed by [[anlage]] and [[evangel|evangels]], and disseminated and taught by the colonial efforts of [[Dawndust|Shindan]], Shindani formed slowly and in decentralized forms as a means to communicate outside of languages which used [[Arckan]] as a basis, to speak without pretenses of sacrilege.
