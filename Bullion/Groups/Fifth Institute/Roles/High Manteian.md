The **High Manteians** are graduate enforcers of the [[Fifth Institute|Manteian Conservatory]], each of whom answer to an [[Alect Keeper]]. They are essentially authorities over [[Chirologist|chirologists]], though High Manteians prefer to go where their underclassmen cannot.

The Manteians are also sometimes called *Alect Corpsmen / Corpswomen,* and their authority is recognized by the [[The Shibboleth|Shibboleth]]’s guilds. The Manteians generally act as ambassadors or diplomatic emissaries to the other lands, and are said to speak an [argot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cant_(language)#Argot) with one another.
