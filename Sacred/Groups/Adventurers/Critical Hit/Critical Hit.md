Sacrosanct Squadron "**Critical Hit**" was an adventuring party who acted as the second-most elite of the royal defenses of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. This scouting and war-fighting party of 7 are legendary, completing many an adventure in the past.

They used to be an elite team within the lore of Sacred's military, completing most any task they were set against, as well as kicking off the [[Age of Adventurers]]. Each remains alive, but largely in retirement, traveling usually for diplomatic purposes and rarely as a full group anymore. 

As of [[1251 PT]], they remain incredibly popular but broken apart and fractured. Recapturing those olden days, should you ask their members, seems nigh impossible now.

# History

Critical Hit began as a group of five dissidents against the nobility of Sacred, named **the Badgers** for their lack of compunction about property damage, formed initially in the last month of [[1211 PT]] in [[Waxtown]]. Over the course of the [[1212 PT|following year]], the Badgers worked in shady jobs so as to remain under the notice of the existing [[Ban of Ignoble Conduct]], which placed an effective ban on adventuring parties and their assembly. 

After being underpaid for forcibly displacing a legion of hobgoblins in the Cirque of Endymion, the party moved to Drastic to escape further notice and to chase stronger opportunities, with [[Junah Rollingstone]] in particular keen on upsetting his [[Bain Rollingstone|father]]'s business at its political roots.

There, the party, now under its modern name, initially met a slightly more accommodating situation, as objectors to the ongoing [[War of the Masters]] were growing in prominence, including especially around the [[Constellar School]], where Ridd deigned to research his weapon and his [[Puretza|patron]]. Despite the capital city being Duke [[Tyranno Re Ursus|Tyranno]]'s homefield, the dense streets and tangled intrigue enabled them to continue to operate more successfully and unpredictably.

## Post-Vault
In the years after, dubbed the Age of Adventurers, they were responsible for many of the more novel additions to [[Drastic]]'s defenses, including the [[Tower of Electron]], although their proper adventures may have ended in at least partial failure.

It was the [[Catharia Incident]] that began the group's decline in friendliness with one another, as well as their individual projects to do with their newfound fame.
