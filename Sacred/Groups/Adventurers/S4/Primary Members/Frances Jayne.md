# History

## Childhood
Born in [[1204 PT]] as the eldest child into a family guided by their religious faith, Frances had a sheltered childhood. Her father was a young student of theology, her mother a composer who’d stumbled into the good graces of a wealthy matriarch who commissioned her regularly to supply her family’s halls with music. Both were well-meaning, if thoroughly unprepared for the mantle of parenthood while barely adults themselves. Within five years, the pair had three children and all the responsibilities and obligations that accompanied them. Times were tight, but they made the best of their situation.

## Teenagehood
Always one to dream beyond the bounds of their humble existence, Frances was only around fifteen years old when she left home, hoping to hone the acting skills she’d practiced in mirrors and tried out on tolerant neighbors. She had big plans for the future, and wouldn’t be satisfied sitting around waiting for things to turn in her favor. Fame would suit her swimmingly, she’d decided early on, and she would take the stage by storm. 

She fell in with a troupe of actors and met a slightly older actress named Gertrude who took her under her wing and showed her the ropes. She was instructed to read pages worth of theory before she could so much as attempt a piece of dialogue, made to watch the experienced actors at work for hours before stepping onto the stage. Learning the in’s and out’s of acting was slow going, but her motivation and passion never wavered as she spent night after night reading through stained scripts and antagonizing over the perfect line delivery.

At the age of 17, like so many children, she too followed the path of her parents before her, finding herself pregnant and woefully unprepared to raise a child. She had no intention of ever being a mother, and the surprise pregnancy was a complication in her great plans for the future. The stage would not wait, nor was it a suitable place for a newborn. So, when the troupe next rolled through a town, she quietly surrendered her infant to a monastery/church/whatevers and resumed her acting studies. She never looked back.

## Young Adulthood
A year or two after this was when she finally began to make notable steps towards her lifelong dream of fame. She landed a leading role that would become her breakout performance. From that point Frances Jayne became a desirable name to include in one’s lineup and went on to act in several of the more successful plays across the kingdom. Things were good. She felt fulfilled as she rode on a wave of success. This was arguably when she was at her peak, though it would not last.  
  

## Adulthood
As trends shifted and her desirability fell out of favor, she found herself playing smaller and smaller roles. She was aging and couldn’t fill the same leading lady roles as before. No longer could she be the snarky young love interest, instead - to her great disdain - she began to take the offered older roles. The matriarch, the matron, the madam. It was enough to drive a woman half mad.  

As time passed she grew more and more frustrated with the tumultuous path of life that had driven her to accept roles far beneath her capabilities. By her early 40’s, she had abandoned the mainstream acting scene almost entirely. She had stopped travelling with the acting troupe and started picking up smaller entertaining gigs to make ends meet. It was a humiliating turn of events for someone who had once tasted fame and loved it. She remained bitter and resentful until the call of adventure awakened that desire for notability again.
