![[âŽ‹ 2FPG]]
A **not-where** is a colloquial [[Witchcraft|witching]] term for a substantially large [[The Fortress|Barrow]] pocket, a [[Plane#Demiplane|demiplane]] shaped for a particular purpose. 

Generally, not-wheres are [[Gravity|gravitationally]] locked due to [[Psinomenon|leyline]]-alignment (meaning a pocket cannot leave a general location). One can be created artificially or naturally.

# Etymology
This definition was specifically coined by [[Dakota Hazelwick]], though use of the term predates them, specifically back to [[protean]] unspeakers who treated the [[Manifold Seas]] as incongruous with their own [[Chartless Sea]].

The term comes from the [[Oa'Rovi|Primordial]] Terran "*Va-qua'po*r" (lit. "not where \[you mean to look]", used poetically as "location without name" or more straight-forwardly "unknown location").
