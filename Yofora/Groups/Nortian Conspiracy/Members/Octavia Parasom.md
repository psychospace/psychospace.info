**Octavia Calliandra Parasom**, genderfluid [[kalashtar]] child of [[Illarion Parasom]], was a ringleader of the [[Heartknock]] along with [[Amanita Parasom|their sibling]].

 Octavia was the first to discover the [[Visage of the Fortress]], and studied it for its anomalous properties.

Like all of the Conspirators, Octavia normally wears the [[Cloak of Excelsio]].

# History
As a young child, [[Amanita Parasom]] at some point entered the [[elseworld]] very briefly.  when a toddler [[Amanita Parasom]] glimpsed the elseworld through a dream of the dark from her [[quori|quori]] guide, her nascent shadow took on a protective spirit, and split, becoming [[Octavia Parasom]].

When they did so, Octavia actualized herself and "split" from Amanita, freeing itself and becoming Amy's twin sister, assuring her that she would never have to feel alone.

It was Octavia's connection to the elseworld that sparked [[Illarion Parasom]]'s concerns that the [[End Times]] would eventually be upon them.
