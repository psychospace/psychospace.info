**Amakudari-no-Mikoto** was an amethyst [[Dragon]] who ruled over [[Ith'Paraan]] for the society's entire existence. Specifically, Amakudari was its name upon reaching [[The Planet]], its birthplace, for the last time. In [[Draconic]], its name means *Earthbound Exalted One*. 

%%It is the most likely origin of the [[Gift of Stars]], for it could travel freely along the infinity of space through the "fixed line" that was its [[Epitome|lifespan]].%%

It also has a name it is known as specifically as the manifestation during its travels among the stars, **Amazakisuishousekiju-no-Ookami**, which calls it the *Great Scholar God of Amethyst Who Split The Heavens*. Upon committing to teaching the world its Gift, the dragon forwent this name.

Its hubris led to the fall of Ith'Paraan when [[Amakudari's phantom|the Promise]] was fulfilled.
