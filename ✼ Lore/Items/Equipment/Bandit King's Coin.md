The **bandit king's coin** is a magic item, an [[antique|antique]] [[Gold piece|gold]] coin of unknown age, minted presumably around the start of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]'s existence. On its obverse side, the head of [[Plesio Falknjir]], founder of Sacred, is depicted, alongside [[Celestial language|Celestial]] [[rune|runes]] that read "For a Bandit, Unity Brings Peace". On the reverse side is a five pointed star with unique filigree, that reads in Celestial "Victory Most Sacred".

This coin initially washed up on the artificial beach in [[Osprey Bay]], and is a trinket in the possession of [[Eldral Levin]].

The coin can't leave it's owners inventory forever unless the owner becomes incredibly unlucky or dies: otherwise, it disappears from wherever it is and reappears in its owner's pocket after they complete a long rest.
