**Valain Stalwart** was the old mentor of [[Alexios Hawthorne]], and an agent of the Hive as part of the [[Spider's Web]]. 

Born in [[Port Fester]], he was a sadistic psychopath and a very skilled combatant, known as a trophy hunter and a human supremacist, seeing peoples that aren't [[Human]] as something to hunt and to claim as a trophy. He's a hardass, he is intense, and Alexios knew that there was more to him than he knows. 

Valain was eventually contracted for the killing of Alexios's sister Melia, since eladrin are very rare: not only because of the pure elven lineage, but also because of the rarity of her kind of blood.

In fear of this, to stop the hit, Alexios killed the woman who put that hit out, [[Solaria Evercleave]], inadvertently sentencing himself to a life of running from the Web.

Alexios hasn't seen Valain in a long while since after he killed Solaria Evercleave.

In reality, Valain has become a [[Witchcraft|warlock]] of [[Lavastus]] as well, creating a conflict of interest that will try to keep Valain at arm's length in his personal quest for revenge.


He eventually was forced into recruiting as part of the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], the final rank XIIIth member inducted before the end of the [[Dragonic War]].

Valain's hair was almost crusty yellow, and his eyes were violet colored.
