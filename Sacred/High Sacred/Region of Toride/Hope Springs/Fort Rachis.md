**Fort Rachis** is a fortification constructed by the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] to protect [[Hope Springs]].

Hope Springs, like [[Rainbow Ridge]], has had a sizable importance in defending [[High Sacred]] from monsters and anomalies of [[the Beastlands]] over the years. To facilitate this, as a more recent addition, [[Sacred Dragoon Force|the Dragoons]] created a small fort here in about [[1206 PT]].

The fort appears to [[Gravity|hover]] on a [[Cloudscape|cloud]] using quantum supposition, via similar mechanics to the spell *reverse gravity*. The cloud roughly orbits Hope Springs but must recharge occasionally, beaching on a shard below the falls, both to watch the border and to make sure the only mainland access is authorized. Its power source is a mystical [[Wraithsword]] called *Storm Reaver* which has been plunged into the rock, which absorbs thunder's energy and utilizes it to rise closer to its home of [[The Above]].

The fort is vaguely triangular in structure, and is staffed by 50 guards. It was one of the many magical breakthroughs achieved by [[Ridd of Chained-Earth|Ridd]], whose home of the Below used similar technology to suspend war machines and monuments in the air.

The word "rachis" is a [[Celestial language|Celestial]] one that means the firm part of a feather, and was originally used by an [[Aasimar]] poet to describe Lace Knights, some of the more specialized law enforcement officers of the older [[Kingdom of Sacred]] (which were eventually merged into the [[City & Castle]] guards in [[Drastic]]).
