**Project KC**[^1] was the term used by the [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] government for a top-secret emergency action plan. Project KC, under official pretenses, would be put in place if the world was believed to be in danger of [[Collapse state|ending]]. ^91a244

The plan (as it was originally written) would have been to transport all of [[Yofora]] and [[Umazia]] into [[The Sheer]], using [[Uforia]] as a buffer-agent if it became necessary, by manipulating the properties of the [[Dustwall]]. ^f6c28b

This was all in order to protect her people and preserve natural resources. KC was so secretive that only the Empress and her [[Lord of Law]] were to know about its true goals until the day came that it was to be put into action.

# History
Project KC was hoped to be improved upon by [[Illarion Parasom]], but reckless ambitions resulted in the [[Nortian Conspiracy]].
