The **Dark Sea** is a [[Plane#Realm|realm]] of [[The Heavens|the Heavens]], a layer extending upwards from [[The Above|the Above]], beyond the reach of mortal life. It is the axiomatic plane of [[Elemental energy|elemental]] [[water]], and is where the twin moons of the Planet, [[Lex]] and [[Ordo]], call home.

This marks the arbitrary limit of the atmosphere of [[The Planet|the Planet]]^[Akin to the [Kármán line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line) of the real world.].

> "It is curious that this layer, of all of them, is anointed the Elemental Plane of Water; the plane so naturally hostile to life, associated with the life-giving element. But indeed, the Dark Sea embodies water's mysteries: the depths that grow more and more treacherous, the vastness stretching on into the horizon without end, the existential forces of nature which turn invisible gears and flow through each and every one of us, and the sourceless ambition to improve ourselves, our society, our world in the chaos of never-ending stars."

It is a realm of shadows, and a realm associated with water and divinity. Many strange [[fish]] and monsters dwell in the Dark Sea. Its upper boundary is debatable, but beyond the pull of the Planet's [[gravity]], the Dark Sea melds with the greater [[Antic Sea]]: some modern astronomers have debated if the terms are redundant. 

It is a matter of debate on the part of the Heavens's inhabitants whether the term of "the Dark Sea" should refer to just one nearby region, one "sea", or the vast infinity of the night sky.

%%The Dark Sea is (perhaps obviously) the largest plane of existence by size: its true size, in fact, is incalculable. As such, it is naturally subject to a variety of mysteries about its true nature, how far the gods reach (if the stories are to be believed) stretches into it, and how one might go about sailing the stars. Of course, no one alive holds the secrets to developing the means of soaring to that height, and what is known is that the plane is devoid of air, and so, little headway has been made in that regard.
