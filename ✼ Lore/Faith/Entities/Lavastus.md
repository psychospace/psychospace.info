**Lavastus** is an [[archfey]] whose domain is that of fortune, creation, and redemption. It is most often attested to by [[Witchcraft|warlocks]]. It has also gone by the names "**Boss**", "**The Stranger**", "**The Author**", or "**The Lost Hunter**". 

It appears, primarily, to those with a "bad hand dealt to them", or those who have "hell to pay". Its aesthetic is needle and thread, the implements of creation and of changing the world. Similar to [[Puretza]]'s manifestation as [[Ridd of Chained-Earth|Ridd]]'s companion, Lavastus was a form of [[Exponen]]'s latent influence on the world. 

Lavastus's primary manifestation is a [[wildwalker]], with a void where its face should be. It has often appeared depicted with tails like a [[kitsune]]. Its body appears to be made of string and burlap, like a voodoo doll. It uses kunai as knitting needles, attached by strings. Around its neck is a sort of poncho that is never finished being sewn together from various patches and pattern, almost like a [[Kary scarf]].

# History

As with many godlike beings, it appears to have arisen in the wake of (or just prior to) [[The Gathering]].

# Current Affairs
In *[[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]]*, [[Alexios Hawthorne]] and his pursuer, [[Valain Stalwart]], were both warlocks of Lavastus. Under the name "The Lost Hunter", it was worshipped by a blood hunter group which [[Chance Seria]] was a part of, and as such it recurred in [[Buttons and Snooze]]'s memories.

In a way, it approached [[Arizhmiya]] in its desire for control, but does so without fear of denial. Due to the closeness of their portfolios, however, Lavastus has begun searching for warlocks like crazy, hoping to stem the tide of those unable to control the world in the wake of Arizhmiya's awakening.
