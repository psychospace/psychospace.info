**Silverswap** is an alternate universe concept created by the players of [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]]. The core deviation from the primary universe, as the name implies, is that [[Sekkan-shin]] and [[Kessah]] swap places. 

In this universe, Kessah acts as the silver [[dragon|dragon]] who gifts power to the champions of [[Barbiche]], while Sekkan-shin acts as the latest champion who embarks on a quest to rescue Prince [[Linnaeus Dino]].
