**Vibe** is a [[Chaos|chaotic]] ethereal fluid which is the core element of [[Psychospace|psychospace]]. At its most basic, Vibe absorbs "willpower" and intent from the area of the [[Wild Blue Yonder|Material Plane]] it borders on, and then takes on properties of that willpower, changing itself. 

If psychospace is a sort of ocean that floods all of [[The Heavens]], Vibe is the water in that ocean. Vibe can be more or less "pure", a property called [[Light (property)|Lightness]].

Vibe can hold willpower and channeled to cast [[Magic]], or converted into physical forms (such as [[Lux]] or [[Mana]]) for other uses, such as powering machines. A measurable "ripple" in Vibe produces an [[Off-wave]], the patterns of which can form [[Psinomenon|psinomenons]].

Vibe is special in that it is an "untouchable" resource in that it cannot exist outside of psychospace, nor can its properties be directly manipulated by creatures. This is because since each living thing has a will of their own, they cannot normally access and manipulate the wills of others, and thus the process of manipulating it becomes difficult. 

Vibe's nature is why [[Figment|figments]] generally exist in an accord with the area they spawn in, such as [[Eidolon|eidolons]] being tasked with defending a town and thus effecting (and being affected by) changes in that community.
