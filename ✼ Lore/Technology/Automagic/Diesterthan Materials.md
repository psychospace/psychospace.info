![[⎋ 2FPG]]
**Diesterthan Materials GmbH**^[(dee - es - tear - thun)] is a materials corporation founded by [[Devil|devils]] from the [[Scarlet Skies]]. They are mainly known for supplying massive quantities of [[noemite]] around the planet for experimentation and production of [[Verlan|verlan]]. The company name is often shortened to **DMAT**, their [[Scarlet Holdings Market]] identifier. 

Through their colossal mining operation on [[Little Candid]], they have also been a leading developer in autonomous verlan systems and logistics. 
# Founding
DMAT was founded in [[1142 PT]] by a group of devils who collectively signed on a charter to form the company. Its purpose was to supply the then dwindling market for materials to the [[Fiend|fiends]] of the Scarlet Skies. The Skies' lack of substantial raw material exports due to its vast ashen wastelands and lack of trade with other [[Plane|planes]] made the market wide open to new entrepreneurs. 

Throughout the [[Wild Blue Yonder]], they were largely unknown until the events of [[Zero Day]]; their early exploitation of Värähnian remnants led to the market having a high demand for their product, and they were equipped to deliver, with their existing fleets of [[Airship#Supraekeic|supraekeic]] mining ships.

## Mass-Produced Automatons
The natural inhabitants and ecosystems of [[Väräh]] are generally hostile towards organic [[Creature|creatures]], so DMAT needed metallic workers to carry out labor on [[Little Candid]]. While not sold publicly, many denizens of the Scarlet Skies are aware of the automatons as DMAT often shows them in advertisements and promotional material. They are produced in a wide range of forms and functions, from foundry workers to giant industrial cranes. 

DMAT produces a very wide range of automatic entities, also called network nodes or just nodes. Their name comes from their connection to DMAT's verlanic network, each entity being a node on the network. Only a small portion of the nodes would be considered "automatons" by most, as all the others have very simple functions without much thought or judgement if at all.
### Interconnectedness
DMAT's internal network, called the **Autonet**, connects all of their nodes together. Physically, every node has some kind of wired connection to a nearby hub of wires. Where the wire connects to the node depends on their design. Certain nodes are allowed to disconnect themselves from the network for short periods of time in case they are relocating a short distance without any connection points along the way. 

Within the Autonet, nodes are able to pass messages to one another. Most messages are operationally relevant, meaning they directly impact DMAT's operation on Little Candid. Some of the messages, however, are between higher-intelligence nodes that are communicating socially. This social communication is highly monitored and restricted by DMAT, but is generally permitted to improve the mood and efficiency of the nodes. In essence, DMAT is allowing them to form friendships and connections to improve their moods and in turn their work improves as well. 
### Intelligence and Emotions
Some nodes are given higher intelligence and basic capacities for emotion. Broadly speaking, these nodes are considered to be automatons as they are able to think, feel, and decide for themselves. Their intelligence and emotions are powered by abstract micro-verlanic systems called cores. Most automatons are given one to four cores, depending on their function set. A special exception to this case are the [[Iensehr|iensehrs]], which are given up to 10 cores depending on their design iteration. 

## [[Noemite#Diestermite|Diestermite]]
DMAT invented their staple alloy to fuel the expansion of their automated systems. Diestermite is used in nearly every aspect of DMAT's operation as a networking medium. Due to the highly networked nature of their operation, most items manufactured by DMAT for internal use have a significant quantity of diestermite.

Diestermite is also one of DMAT's main exports. Due to the general rise in demand for verlanic systems. some have opted for DMAT's direct-contact implementation of [[Dust tunnel|dust tunnel]] propagation.
