[[BPT 55122]] < here > [[BPT 55120]]

The Starcrater [[Blackflame]] is used to incubate the [[Dragon]] eggs of [[Sakuya and Ninigi|red Sakuya and blue Ninigi]]. After 660 days, the children are born: [[Uforia|Yamasachi]] and [[Arahabaki|Umisachi]], twin shadow-dragons who both possess immense and esoteric power â€” and in separate eggs, silver dragon [[Sekkan-shin|Hosuseri]] and copper dragon [[Vergoldeter Minutenzeiger Panikdrache|Tomanoya]], apparent metallic bastards of chromatic heritage.

As a result of the flame, Sakuya and Ninigi are both afflicted with *[[Aphasia crystalis]]*. Sakuya nurtures the shadow dragons, succumbing to the curse in the Starcrater. Ninigi takes Tomanoya and Hosuseri to Low Sacred, abandoning them in the [[Giant Forest]] before succumbing after another 660 days.
