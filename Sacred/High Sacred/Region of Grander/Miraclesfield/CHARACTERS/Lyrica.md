**Lyrica Liesel Amia** is a [[Visitant]]; a clone of [[Lazuli Dino]].

Crafted from the prince's sense of authority, she was [[Ikabod Caruso]]'s first creation for the purpose of curing the [[Dragonic Curse]], deemed a failure. 

During [[Red Spark]], her unconscious body fled the [[Ivan's Tiger|Ivan's Tiger]] and traveled to [[Miraclesfield]]. There, she was taken in by [[Hester Vandal]], joining the [[Bad Daisies]] at the [[Suntower Theater]].

She acts as the big sister of the visitants, believing herself capable of saving the soul of Sacred, and has quickly picked up a mastery over playing the guitar. She wants to assist the BDs in raising the morale of those in Miraclesfield, although Hester wanted to protect the amnesiac from the dangers of the world, leading to push-and-pull. 

She is also partly comprised of the aspect of the prince that was often stowed away, his immense love for family: Lyrica harbors some of this same apprehension, wanting to hide her true emotions from others because she believes she must undertake the burden of the world.
