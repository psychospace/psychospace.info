***Magical Mystery Tour***, also known as **MMT** or "**Campaign 1**", is a campaign in D&D5e which lasted from January 24th, 2020, until February 4th, 2024. It was Game Mastered by January November. 

In-universe, the adventure began in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], in the final month of [[1250 PT]], and followed the fraught events preceding and during the [[Dragonic War]], concerning the journeys of those connected to Prince [[Lazuli Dino]]. It is the first game run in (and invented) [[The Heavens]].

>The prince of Sacred, Linnaeus "[[Lazuli Dino|Linnie]]" Dino, requests capable individuals to escort him and his companion along the long and difficult trek back to the capitol in time for the Summit of Sacred at Year's Start. Rewards include: [[Gold piece|gold]], property in the capitol, the favor of the prince, the chance to experience the myriad creatures and features of the dangerous regions of Low Sacred, and complimentary tickets to the events of the Summit of Sacred upon your arrival in the capitol. Non-adventurers need not apply. By applying to this position as royal escort, you assume the risks of adventuring: incineration, sickness, deep-frost, disintegration, [[Psionics|psychic]] dismemberment, extramagical disappearance, death(s), radiation, curses, monster-related trauma, [[Confluence|psychospacial torrents]], etc.

## Opening Narration
>[!quote | author] Narration
>In this mighty world known as the Heavens, "disks" of earth, called remnants, remain floating amidst a sky of endless clouds. This world experienced an end, one way or another, long ago, but even that end is now an ancient start.
>
>Now all we have are the pieces of that shattered existence, which remain bound to us by the miraculous realm of psychological existence, simply called psychospace for short. From this realm came magic itself, and all its creations: truly, this place lives up to its divine title. It is impossible to know what exactly ended the world so long ago, but it is likely tied to the existence of psychospace...
>
>In the Year of the Lotus Broken, 1250 Pinwheel Tempo, on the remnant known as Sacred, a quest has sparked your interest.
>
>Prince Linnaeus "Linnie" Dino of Drastic, and his traveling companion Ildy, the eidolon guardian of Drastic, request adventurers as back-up as they prepare for the Summit of Sacred to occur on the dawn of the new year. While on their way to the edgeland settlement of Rainbow Ridge, supposedly to gather up guests for the summit, they lost much of their royal guard escorts to a peculiar magic storm, displaced to parts unknown. This follows a proclamation from the king a month prior, which has placed a temporary ban (or at least a strong warning) on teleportation magic due to this storm, which has yet to be understood by wizards.
>
>The remaining royal guardsmen are likely not enough should the storm cross paths with the Prince again; to replace the manpower, Ildy and the Prince have requested folks as guards and escorts back to Drastic. It seems the Prince is worried that another tragedy may befall his group upon their return, or maybe that is just the feeling you get.
>
>In exchange for this task, the Prince offers a gold prize, an offer of property in the capitol, his gratitude (which doesn't come easy), as well as guaranteed tickets to the Summit's events. In addition, the trip itself, along an alternate route back to the castle, will take several days and nights, during which they will be passing through several smaller towns in Sacred's lower half, which are rarely graced by the prince and are largely thought to be uncontrolled borderlands. The prince and the escort group will likely offer relief effort to those hit by the storm, as well as investigate any curiosities or strange happenings in each stop along the way.
