>***Dearest [[Successor (Nortia)|Successor]] and your kin.***

I will not yield in my goal to protect this world. But fighting [[S4|these adventurers]]… it is a losing game. Should I fail, as perhaps I know I might, I wish for the world to know of what happened here. 

And of course, you. [[Serena Nortia|You]], who I know, in my heart of hearts, is reading this.

When you take my freedom from me, may your aim be true. You are the light of [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]]. I am sorry the sacrifices we both have had to make to save everyone. I am sorry the torment I have not meant to put you through. I am sorry the betrayal you feel in your heart. 

There is a grim shadow over this path I have walked. I have elected to record my involvement with the events as they have occurred, in the process of saving this reality, as perhaps an attempt to set the events straight, as I have seen them transpire. Whether or not you believe my words is for your own mind to ponder.

What is proven by the [[Visage of the Fortress#Anomaly|anomaly]] discovered and re-shared by the authorship of *Visage* is that there remains accessible gaps in the divine tapestries of the world: just like [[Phantasm|phantasms]], but for other dimensions. This was already known to [[Divination|diviners]], but the nature of the gaps we had found are those that simply exist in reality’s very continuity.

These are gaps which, as could be seen from the bubble's nature, may one day cause a [[TPK]] to come about -- or something even worse yet, that has not a name. 

It was long believed that most of the most major gaps had been closed by [[the Gathering]]’s effects on the world -- the [[Lynchpin device|lynchpin devices]] as well as the [[The Planet#Planar stack|planar stack]] -- but if even schoolchildren could access these gaps, and they were being proliferated at random, we were suddenly placed in a much more dire position. ^aa2e3b

It was found that the bubble's influence appeared to be benign, despite consuming almost any physical attempts to move or destroy it. However, this was soon disproven, as on one harrowing evening, I returned home to find that the [[Farborough Manor|manor]] had been consumed by it entirely. 

It flickered back into reality once [[Octavia Parasom|Octavia]], trapped by it, managed to reduce it again: a swollen wound reacting to a cold rag. But evidently, the reinforcements we placed on the manor to contain the bubble were never going to be absolute assurance on its safety, and the costs that “[[The Signal|whispering sound]]” made on the twins' minds was too great to ignore.

The change we face soon is imminent and vast. And so, the scenario held a potential we could not ignore as statesmen. I began to confer again with Empress [[Bianca Nortia|Bianca]], and together, we named the scenario [[Zero Day]], in which reality would be destroyed by malignant forces like the bubble, enabled by the dangerous carelessness of the gods. In which one would become zero. A Second Gathering, if ever there was such thing, only this time… I was not sure what would be left behind.

And if you are reading this letter, then we have either succeeded in preventing it, or we live in an unwritten destiny.

I have done so many horrible things to your family, to my family, to you and to myself. These are the only costs I cannot abide. I have done so many horrible things to [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]], in pursuit of the [[Occultation|immovable object]]. And I have ruined my chances at redemption, to go back, to think better. I only hope you live in better times than the ones I have created.

If I am dead, then my estate falls into the *true* empress's hands: not into the hands of [[Scarla Nitrum|whatever demon it is that I have fed]]. It is what little restitution I can offer. Allow my manor to become a place of healing the world. Healing from the wounds I have scored it with: not of harming it, destroying it into shapes that fit our views.

I know now that everything I have done has signed my death warrant: all I have done to bring about a world of abundance, a world that will survive me. **A world for you.** And yet, I remain your loyal servant, and your eyes will cast righteous judgement on my acts. 

One man alone cannot pick up all the pieces he has scattered, blown about as ash to the winds. All he can do is ensure they receive a proper burial.

No matter what happens, no matter what horrors assault us, you must keep the light alive, for all peoples, for everyone, for those who are left.

**Keep the darkness at bay.**

That is my one and singular wish. And it is all I can leave you with.

I divest in my words the utmost power I can muster.
