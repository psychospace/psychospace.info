**Miguel Jaeger** is a [[Human|human]] investigator.

# History
Born in [[1219 PT]], they grew up in the bustling city of [[Anacoreta]]. At the time, the city was known for its high crime rate and political intrigue. Inspired by the great detectives of literature, he dedicated himself to becoming a detective, seeking to bring criminals to justice and uncover the truth behind the world's mysteries and conspiracies.

## Current affairs
In the month of Vire, [[1249 PT]], they were killed unfairly in Anacoreta, shot in the back of the head by someone that worked for the police. The perpetrator was, in reality, a vague associate in the pocket of someone else. 

They were then [[Mass-Resurrection Incident|revived]] by a [[The Pitcher|pallid stranger]]. Without explanation or cause for the event, they are interested in the bounty offered by the [[Daily Grind]] for personal reasons, mostly to discover the truth of the matter. 

# Personality
Despite their casual way of speaking and disheveled appearance with a keen intellect and an eye for detail, they gained reputation for solving complex cases with unorthodox methods. Their expertise lies not only in investigative skills but also in knowledge of alchemy, allowing them to discern the hidden secrets of both people and potions.

Their dedication to the craft and their unwavering determination make them a formidable force in the pursuit of truth.
