**Lifeblinding** is a study of [[Magic]] that involves the extension or amplification of a [[Figment|figment]]'s [[Epitome|state of existence]] by using a [[Soul|soul]] as [[Tribute|tribute]], usually the caster's own. As it is an act which incentivizes stealing souls, it has been entirely outlawed throughout the [[Wild Blue Yonder]] as a heretical [[Wild Magic|wild magic]] for the dangers it poses to natural instincts, morality, sanity, and magical safety.
# History
Certain aspects of magic are tied to vital energy, or to timers that limit their utility, or to links to souls that create hard numeric limits on spells. For centuries, [[Wizardry|wizards]] have sought ways to circumvent these inherent boundaries of magic. 

One such manner, discovered by one of [[Viers Callinan]]'s early apprentices, [[Ghen Sherak]], was a [[Curse|cursed]] **mark of lifeblind** made upon the flesh that further reinforced the bond between a magical creator and its creation. The creator often had a psychic link to another creature.

# Concept
The mechanics of lifeblinding are such that a magical creation that should have vanished becomes perpetuated (in essence, alive) through the burden placed on a marked soul in exchange for that perpetuation. The burden increases exponentially for each creation perpetuated by this method, and a subject maintained in this method must fulfill certain properties to continue on its own if the mark is removed.

On top of aging normally, the marked caster will undergo aging simultaneously for every creation they have burdened themselves with. Put simpler, a caster maintaining a single creature through lifeblinding ages the equivalent of two days for every one day that passes.

This burden extends beyond aging, however, onto shared emotions and mutual suffering, thus making the abandonment or experimentation of creations bonded like this a veritably difficult task to do safely.

When someone invokes the art of lifeblinding, so it is named for, they are willingly ignoring the survival principles inherent in all living things in favor or perpetuating something descended from them, rather than themselves. This act of self-destruction in the pursuit of progress is often a sign of desparation or determination on the part of the caster.

Should the caster die, all creations maintained in such a manner will die if they cannot maintain themselves otherwise.
