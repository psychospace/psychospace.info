**Triptych** is a newer town built in the late 1220s to give displaced goblinoids, orcs, and other sorts, a place to live in peace, should they want it, in society. One of the largest cities outside of [[Drastic]], it is split into quarter-cities, known as Ashera, Anatt, Astarte, and Abaziro.

Of all of the cities on the remnants of [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]], Triptych holds the most dubious distinction, as well as easily the most complicated status at present. While the largest singular city by size, it is more accurate to call it something closer to its own duchy, a metropolitan area that encompasses the entirety of the Northern Limit, everywhere from the Obsidian Shores to Costa Bianca. So in addition to its limits counting the four quarters of the town of Triptych, it also encompasses the myriad villages which outline the old trade routes of the North.

It, and the surrounding countryside, is ruled over by a separate "duke" to the rest of Grander, known as the Overmaster. The current Overmaster is [[Udici Dromeda]], a female goliath who ruled over the mountains in the region.
