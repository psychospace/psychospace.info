**Gravity** is a [fundamental attractive force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity) which affects anything that has mass, drawing them together. This process creates the force which, for example, has led to the formation of [[Star|stars]] [[Out There|Out There]]. 

In the context of [[The Heavens]], gravity is a [[Logic|logical]] force controlled by the [[Plane|planar]] locale of an object. 

In [[Plane#realm|Material Realms]], gravity behaves predominantly as it does in the real-world. [[The Planet]] has the exception of [[remnant|remnants]] themselves, suspended by [[Phantasm|phantasms]] created by [[Kibangan]], locking their gravity relative to the spin of [[The Below|the Below]]. Upon the [[Flipside|flipsides]] of the remnants, gravity is locked opposite that of the topside. 

In many other planes, gravity is not so assured.
