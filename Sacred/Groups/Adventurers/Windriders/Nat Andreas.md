Nataly Andreas, known as "Nat" to her friends is a deaf fair-skinned [[Human]] barbarian woman of 31. Leads the group [[Adinah Ilacqua|Adinah]] sends out to scavenge, talking with sign language. She has apparently been documented being able to hear while in a rage.

Originally from the remnant of [[Umazia]], Nat survived the harsh realities of working under Nortia's bootheel only barely with the help of [[Jenks]] and [[Squiddly]]. She apparently became deaf due to the ridiculous noise levels she was forced to endure while working the Darkzone of [[Umazia]], where its airships are built and deployed.
