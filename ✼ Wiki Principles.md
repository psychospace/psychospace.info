This incomplete page contains information on how [[✼ Psychospace.info]] articles are styled and may be referenced.

# General
The following rules are intended to apply wiki-wide.
- **Rule of Intention** - Articles are written in a system-agnostic manner.
- **Rule of Notability** - Notable subjects will receive articles.
- **Rule of Triviality** - Articles might not exist, or links may be broken, if their subject(s) is not notable.

Sub-rules also apply.
- **Rule of Precedence** - An article will be created when another notable subject's article cannot cover the subject sufficiently. 
	- i.e. the topic of types of dragon are sufficiently covered by headers in the [[Dragon]] article.
- **Rule of Assumption** - An article will be created when that article would amount to more than "the subject exists".
	- i.e. player characters' homes would generally not receive note, as their containing location is probably sufficient. Not every citizen of [[Drastic]] needs their own article.
- **Rule of Spontaneity** - An article will be created for an unplanned or improvised element if it *becomes* notable.
	- i.e. The duergar of [[Otell Sanctum]] would not receive articles, as Otell Sanctum suffices, but [[Magnet (tiefling)|Magnet]] has an article because the [[S4]] interacted differently with him.

## Rule of Intention
![[⎋ Gameplay]]
**System-agnostic** means:
- No TTRPG system's gameplay descriptions (e.g. gameplay mechanics, stat blocks) will need to be understood to understand the contents of the wiki.
- If the wiki lacks context that would support or reject the existence of something (for example, a specific animal, "class" or "spell"), it is **open to definition**.

Links to places like *Archives of Nethys* intended to eventually be replaced and rewritten to be agnostic. 

The end-goal of becoming system agnostic is a universe that does not require external sources to support its content, as well as offering its own, "Heavens-flavored" interpretation of system-typical elements. This should also allow fans of the work to create their own interpretations.

## Rule of Notability
Articles are created for *notable subjects* in the world. Generally, I use the [Wikipedia Notability tests](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability), adapted for this purpose. Because the only sources are stories, we can use that as a measure.

Notable subjects include:
1. Subjects well-covered in a story, the obvious picks (i.e. [[1250 PT]])
2. Subjects that are key elements in a story (i.e. [[Blackflame]])
3. Subjects that are common knowledge in-universe (i.e. [[Critical Hit]])
4. Subjects that are fundamentally understood as parts of the universe (i.e. [[Magic]])
5. Player characters in roleplays ( #meta/PLAYER )
6. Subjects which are the non-trivial settings of stories (i.e. [[Drastic]])
7. Subjects which are **reliably relevant** to stories (i.e. [[Linnaeus Dino]])

"Reliable relevance" can be assessed for a subject by these criteria:
- Appears in more than one story or session (i.e. [[Buttons and Snooze]])
- Appears in a character's history, titles, or key experiences in a non-trivial manner (i.e. [[Macha]])
- Appears in a single story in a non-trivial manner (i.e. [[Enoch Starfell]])

A notable subject must also be without reason to have its article redacted in its entirety (i.e. [[Nortian Conspiracy]]).

**All notable subjects should receive articles.** Generally, notable subjects that should receive an article (but don't have one, yet) include:
* intentionally hidden information (i.e. major villains)
* low-priority notable subjects (i.e. different classes)
