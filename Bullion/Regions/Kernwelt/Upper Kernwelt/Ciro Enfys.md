**Ciro Enfys** is a [[Elf#Half-elf|half-elf]] [[witchcraft|witch]], apparently born with strange, uncontrollable powers.
# History

Ciro was evidently born in [[1227 PT]] in [[Philda's Reach]]. According to the [[Base (XI)|First Baseman]], as a kid, she grew up in [[Estelis Ranch]], though her preternatural connection to a mysterious [[Curse]], as well as her '[[Gift of Stars|gift of stars]]', led to her abilities running often rampant, unintentionally killing her parents, family, and caretakers. Eventually, when she was left all alone, a man from '[[Fifth Institute|a school]]' came to protect her.

In [[1243 PT]], she was around 16, photographed in an [[ambrotype]] as playing [[skitball]] with a [[The Pitcher|pallid figure]] on the [[Regina Steppe]].

In [[1249 PT]], Ciro's name was found later when "victims" of the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]] discovered it in the wreckage of Estelis Ranch. The ambrotype gave them the name "the Pitcher" for the entity responsible for the incident. 

Ciro's name was later heard of again when, on the [[train]] to [[Regina]], the victims discovered a stitched hole in the ground.
