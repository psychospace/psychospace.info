**Holrfold** was an ancient [[Dwarf|dwarvish]] civilization of [[Bullion]] which existed in the [[Kernwelt]]. Having their origins in tribes of nearby [[Archipel]], their architecture and cultural artifacts have continued to influence the world.

# Etymology
"Holrfold" is the modern name for what is an unknown civilization name. In their time, their self-identity was the tribe of "djúprfólk" (deep folk), however extensive cross-mentions between the other tribes of [[Bullion]] do not corroborate this self-identification.

# History
Holrfold had multiple eras of history. They initially made an impact on the remnant during the late [[Bullion#First Era|first era]]. The changes to the ability to foster life in the upper layer during the [[Bullion#Second Era|second era]] resulted in Holrfold's proper creation.

By the time of the middle [[Bullion#Third Era|third era]], Holrfold's people had evolved into a hybrid society in the [[Upper Kernwelt]]. When the [[Os'Grun]] impact occurred, much of this hybrid era was thrown into archaeological turmoil by the seismic event and the outbreak of [[Angel's cough]]. Hundreds of years after the impact, the successor society of [[Sirrhad]] was initially formed by survivors of the impact.

# Culture
The dwarves of Holrfold had a cultural fixation on craftsmanship and ownership. Fascinated with naturalism, many things they built or used were actively living creatures or plants which since fossilized or evolved. They also held a spiritual view of nudity, believing it to be a "pure" state. They also constructed golems powered by [[Elemental energy]] by the same token. It is believed by some that they found contact with [[conrasu|conrasus]]. 

Holrfold's predominant faith was monotheistic and venerated various bounties of the earth, such as gemstones. This created tension with their polythiestic neighbors in [[Ith'Paraan]], with the dwarves refusing to worship or recognize any other deities than their tribal deity, which they refuse to name to outsiders. Inside their culture, their deity was known as [[Nárjǫrð]], the Corpse World.

Holrfolk believed that ancestor worship was immensely important. The dead were often buried in bodies of still water, allowing them to foster life for years to come. The ruling authority of Holrfold was a caste of undead elder priests, known as the [[Stonewalker|Stonewalkers]]. Similar to a monastic order, this "becoming one" with the earth is something intended to rid the body of impurity through meditation. They hibernate as statues for centuries but can be communed with.

Holrfold's predominant society had a distaste for outsiders. Hill dwarves and others outside of Holrfold's traditional lands were culturally influenced into merchant roles, giving them an unfair reputation for greed.
