# Events


In summer, [[Critical Hit]] unlocks the [[Vault of Foretelling]] underneath [[Drastic]] and acquires a hidden stash of 750,000 [[Gold piece|gold pieces]]. This gold is split half to the party, and returning half to the [[Kingdom of Sacred]].

Using the gold granted to them, the Kingdom under [[Hadro Dino]] brokers a peace treaty and trade agreement with [[Dawndust]], ending the [[War of the Masters]] at last. Per terms of the treaty, Dawndust is forced to reconfigure itself before it can ally itself with Sacred. All allies of the conflict are hence allowed to make further choices in how they act.

In [[Rainbow Ridge]], [[Abyz]] spawns at the "Twin Tree".
