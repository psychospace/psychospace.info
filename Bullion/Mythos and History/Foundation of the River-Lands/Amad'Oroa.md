**Amad'Oroa**^[(ah-MAHD-oh-ROH-ah)] of the Golden North, also called the Vagrant King, is a mythological figure of [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Reyezuela]], whose feats of legend and works of art are said to have helped create the cultural archetype known today as a [[wildwalker]]. 

Amad'Oroa and his creations, typically sculptures and engravings, are attested to in the early [[Bullion#Fourth Era|Fourth Era]], along with other late-mythic figures in the founding of the River-Lands. Based on depictions of the time, he was likely a [[genasi]]-[[Elf|elf]]. 

Said to be imbued with the insight of the [[Divinity|gods]], Amad'Oroa was a muse throughout the northern [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]] who is credited with creating multiple sites of artistic and cultural import. Using his insight, he apparently was gifted with the ability to sense and imbue meaning into various "saints", what he said were beings of pure virtue, starting with [[Maedil Rysae]]: this began an honor that persisted into modern day.

It was also said he shaped a number of [[Lynchpin device|lynchpin devices]] as offerings to various gods, including to [[Bioh|Se√±ora Verde]]. Among many weapons said to have been tools of his, he was said to harbor a claw of [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]], its last remains.

The circumstances of Amad'Oroa's passing is as unknown as his point of origin, but around the time of [[Itherin Rysae|Ithuriel II]], attestations dry up.
