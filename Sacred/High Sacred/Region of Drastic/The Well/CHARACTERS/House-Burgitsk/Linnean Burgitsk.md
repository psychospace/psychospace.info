**Linnean Burgitsk** was the [[Elf|half-elf]] royal advisor of King [[Hadro Dino]]. Serving Hadro in the latter half of his rule, Linnean offered wise advice during the [[War of the Masters]].

Linnean is nowadays retired in his waning years, acting as father to his children of [[House Burgitsk]], including the current royal officiant [[Mistral Taylor Burgitsk]]. 

[[Linnaeus Dino]]'s name was a tribute to Linnean.
