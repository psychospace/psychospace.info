A **mocker**, also termed a **mock engine**, is an [[Illusion|illusory]] and [[Automagic|automagic]] device which is used in the protection of covert structures and [[Airship|airships]]. 

About the size of a large closet, the mocker casts a sort of [[glamour]] over the whole structure to conceal its true nature, unless someone is aware of its exact location. It is the [[Magic|magical]] equivalent of [active camo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_camouflage), and, basically, copies the "scene" and [[Echo|echoes]] which naturally surround the structure, to prevent echoes from the structure itself from seeping obviously into the environment. This can even fool [[psychospace]] and cause a spatial-distortion effect, not unlike the effects of a [[not-where]].

The mocker was first invented during the [[War of the Masters]] by [[NIMROD]], to shorten ritual setup periods during take-off procedures for its most secure operations.
