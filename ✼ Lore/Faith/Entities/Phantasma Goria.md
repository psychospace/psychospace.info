**Phantasma Goria** was a strange [[Psychopomp|psychopomp]]-like woman who appeared within the [[Ghost storm|purple storm]]. She was apparently some kind of manifestation of sin, and her existence was the work of several gods, primarily [[Exponen]]. 

She chases those who dodge their fates and portends a mysterious awakening (in truth, the approach of [[Arizhmiya]]). Though only hearsay, Goria is creating some kind of parade of young souls. While it is rumored that the apparition within the storm is the one guiding it, this is not the case.

Her name means "a gathering of ghosts", or alternatively "a ghost in the open".
