The **Adyu Islands** (Острова Адю) are a minor geographic region of [[Yofora]], consisting of several tiny landmasses. It acts as an oblast of [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]].

They are comprised of [[Anima]], [[Animus]], [[Rekiye]], and [[Reshitel]].

The [[Successor (Nortia)|Successor]] has been formally decreed given these realms by right: though the position is mostly formal, the Successor does have immense sway on the activities of that territory in particular.

# History

The Adyu Islands were said to once be the home of a monastery, who worshipped the [[Demon|demons]] of [[Tantalus]] in an attempt to create an accord with them. This myth is most likely false, created by demons as an exploit to obtain easy to find prey. In modern days, demons have been long ago driven from these islands. 

# Etymology

“Ad’yu” in [[Oa'Rovi|Auran]] means “new moon” (comprised of ‘Ad’ lunar, night sky, stars + ‘yu’ pinnacle.)
