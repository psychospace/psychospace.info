**Vorpal** is a quality of either a material or enchantment, which, when forged into a weapon, is described as powerful enough to decapitate nearly any [[creature]].

The term arose with a mythological association with the first known [[Avatar of Death]], also known as "[[Vorgon'vor|the Most-Careful]]". "Vorpal" is an old word which means "like the most-careful", or "precise", and has the connotation of "bringer of ends".
