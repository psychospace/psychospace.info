**Drastic** is the capital city of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], located in middle [[High Sacred]] along the [[Grand Watersea]]. Though scarred by a number of wars which have graced it, it remains as an impressive work and important city to this day. Many tall buildings mark its proud skyline. 

Drastic and [[The Well]], its sister city, are inhabited by about 280,000 individuals, almost a third of High Sacred's population, making the region one of the most populous in all of the [[Mer de Vide]].

Under the [[Carapa Republic]], the city was its capital, known as the Holy Port of Ace.

# Leadership

Although also the center of a duchy, it no longer has a duke as of its most recent, [[Tyranno Re Ursus]], ascending to the station of king-consort. 

Drastic's eidolon is [[Rinzal]]. Previously, it was [[Ildy]], but he was claimed in the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]].

# Locations
## Walljay Quarter (SW)
Long ago, a stone wall surrounded the Holy Port, built before [[airship|airships]] existed to trivialize them. This wall has fallen to deterioration over time, and sometimes the towers, quarters, and forts built within the wall have been repurposed.

The **Walljay Quarter** is a district of [[Drastic]]. It is the predominant merchant quarter, named for the large bluebirds that perch on the outside walls and ferry messages to and from the [[Tower of Electron]]. This quarter faces out towards [[The Well]], and is in the west of the city.

## Heavenland Quarter (SE)
The **Heavenland Quarter** is the most "suburban" of [[Drastic]]'s districts, primarily containing shrines, churches, cathedrals, or temples to various gods and houses in between them.

The Heavenland Quarter is in the southeast of the city.

## Kopyc District (N)

Named for the first Master of Military, [[Sumiah Kopyc]], the **Kopyc District** is the lower-rung of society in [[Drastic]], existing farther inland along defunct canals and winding riverbeds now built into the structure of the city itself. While originally proposed to house militia, it now mostly acts as economy housing.

## Olympia Quarter (S)

The **Olympia Quarter** of [[Drastic]] is known for its impressive architecture: the majority of the city's elite live here, near to the [[Constellar School]] and the [[Astral Lighthouse]]. It's in the south middle of the city.

## Premier District (NW)
The **Premier District** of [[Drastic]] contains [[Saurus Castle]] and could be known for little else than that, save its high-echelons of society. Many impressive homes lie here, as well as impressive shops and impressive battlements along [[Battery Avenue]]. It is surrounded by a large interior wall, built during the time of the [[Dakouta Dino|Twindragons]].
