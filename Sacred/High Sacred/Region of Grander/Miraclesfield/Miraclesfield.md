**Miraclesfield** is a major town in the [[Glass Mountains]] in the east of [[High Sacred]]. It is known for its shipbuilding and mining operations, such as through the [[Rollingstone Mining Company]].

Its [[Shindani]] name is a rough literal translation of an originally [[Mänyya|Elvish]] name, more accurately described as the “Town of a Thousand Gods”. With the ancient existence of [[The Godsteps]], there should be no question why it earned this name.
