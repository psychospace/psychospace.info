The **Great Empire of Nortia**, typically shortened to simply **Nortia** is a large empire and world power of the [[Mer de Vide]], with a rich culture and secretive nature. 

Under the [[Nortian imperial family]], it governs the remnants of [[Yofora]], where its capital city of [[New Orc City]] resides, and [[Umazia]]. The empire has been an impressive force for change throughout the eons, regularly producing powerful technology through their royal line's connection to the ethereal [[The Sheer|Sheer]]. 

# Structure
The empire is separated into **oblasts** which are individually governed by principal governors. Much of its land is considered the property of various noble families. 

Nortia is traditionally ruled by an [[Empress of Nortia|emperor or empress]], though since the [[0 PT|turn of the epoch]] has also had a [[Lord of Law]] to oversee their [[Conductors of Court|court system]]. 
# Etymology
*Nortia* is an ancient phrase associated with an avatar of fire, believed to be a nymph servant of [[Mynos]]. It is said that *nortia* was originally a [[Golden Voice|word of power]] that was stripped of direct strength, a word that defined the creation of the [[Scarlet Skies]]. [[Uforia]] apparently had used this word for her empire to protect itself from [[Out There|outer]] influence.
# History
In ancient times, on angel's wing, [[Uforia]] was taken to Yofora.
## The Coalescence
In 7800 BPT, after a witness discovered and spread news of Uforia's influence, each of five ancient cities raised their chosen champions, the *apostle-knights*, champions of tribalistic armies, in order to capture the dragon and impose their beliefs on reality. 

As they approached, they were each met by [[Valerian|Valerian Nortia]], who protected it by drawing on [[Ekaitz]]'s energy.

These five apostle-knights shared in immaculate reality-altering dreams as a result of Valerian's immense [[Monism|psychic power]], which was said to shatter their wills and bind them all. Each of the peoples of Yofora warred and toiled with one another, but thanks to Uforia and the first of the [[Nortian imperial family|imperial line]], they suddenly were given a common tongue: they felt what one another felt and began to believe that their own minds were not meant to be their own. In this realization, despair began to sow in their souls. 

To ease what it knew was pain, Uforia granted each of the apostle-knights new names. These names were said to be themselves words of power, speaking the [[Divine Equation]] in a literal sense. Their tribes would bear their old names. 

Through this anointment, the five apostle-knights were granted the strength enough to bear the Eldestborn’s untrained gifts, and instead sympathized into united wills, rather than disintegrated into a single will. 

Bound by the events, over the course of several hundred years, the armies and struggling magic peoples merged into a coherent culture, and thus the Empire was formed — and the [[Cradling Hand]]'s center, the distorted landscape which housed Uforia, became [[Orkrengrad]], the City of Orchestration.

## Modern History
During the [[War of the Masters]], Nortia was the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]'s ally in their efforts against [[Dawndust]].

During the [[Dragonic War]], she saw an attempted coup from the [[Nortian Conspiracy]].
