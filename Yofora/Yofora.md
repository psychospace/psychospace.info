**Yofora**^[Йофора] is a [[Remnant]] which today makes up part of the [[Great Nortian Empire]]. A geographically diverse remnant, it largely is comprised of tundra forests and high mountains. Deep within is [[Uforia]], which was how the remnant was named. 

Nortia controls this remnant as its primary focus, and employs the complex magic of [[Weather]] alteration in order to assure its people are properly fed, using the [[Eyes of Uforia]].

# Geography
Yofora is surrounded by the [[Dustwall]], a phenomenon which usually cuts it off from the outside world. Many of its biomes are various forms of taiga, though warmer, more mountainous regions exist in the north. Its [[flipside]] is [[Tantalus]].

Yofora harbors three oblasts of the empire: the [[Adyu Islands]], the [[Cradling Hand]], and [[Mozga-Chelyust]].

# History
It is believed that as the [[Divinity|gods]] took shape at the [[Old world|dawn of this world]], one stepped or stood upon Yofora, pushing it lower under the might until it dwelt in the twilight between the [[Wild Blue Yonder]] and [[Scarlet Skies]], granting [[Pothesis]] the foothold it needed to take charge, and causing its flipside to be that of an [[The Abyss|Abyssal]] layer.

Later, after it was born to [[Sakuya and Ninigi]], [[Uforia]] was brought to Yofora on [[angel]]'s wings, and its abilities and nature swiftly began to distort the surroundings. Shortly after it was brought here, the [[Dustwall]] manifested itself.
