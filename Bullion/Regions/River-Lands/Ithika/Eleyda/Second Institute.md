The **Ponderosa-Sommers University of the Ithika Valley**, shortened affectionately to "*PoSo*", also known as the **Second Institute of [[Bullion]]**, is an [[Eleyda|Eleydan]] educational institution funded by the [[Luminaria]]. It is an important, historical university in the history of the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]], coming into being around the [[3rd century PT]]. 

As of [[1249 PT]], her headmaster is [[Andhelt Stane]].

# History
## Origins
The longest-standing educational institution on the remnant and in the [[The Shibboleth|Shibboleth]], the Ponderosa-Sommers University is named for the two original leaders of the [[Sganyodaiyo]], Camillo Ponderosa and Kolin Sommers. They owed their success in combat to their teachings at a monastery in the [[Valle Ins√≥lito]], and dedicated much of the fortune they acquired as conquistadors to the process of improving educational standards in the River-Lands. They originally founded the [[First Institute]], and when that burned down, the Second Institute was dedicated in their stead.

## Eras
Historians generally agree there to be three "eras" of the Second Institute. One was after its founding until around the [[7th century]], while [[Ithuriel XI]] was in power. Following the monarch's martyrdom and the anointing of [[Ithana Rysae|Ithuriel XII]], a shift began to occur in the school that moved it towards being more accepting of non-elves, though its admission process remained highly biased. 

The second era remained in this state until the end of the [[War of the Masters]] in [[1216 PT]]. The Shibboleth's refactoring and further integration following that conflict rendered the Second Institute increasingly out of date. A process of modernization occurred as Eleydan interests and increased immigration to Bullion pushed the Second Institute's leadership to fully integrate and allow other minorities to attend and (more importantly) teach at and take leadership roles at the university.
