**Elves** are a diverse group of #sapient  peoples who are partly [[fey]]. Long-lived and characterized by their wisdom, elves are ancient and have excellent memories, and their many civilizations and collective art and literature prove this. Though culturally typically standoffish, elves have a duty to their communities often fulfilled through many foci they will master over the course of their life.



A group of elves is commonly known as a **party**, though this terminology has become less specific to the elves themselves over the years.

# Traits

It's said by elven folklore that all sentient people, elves included, were once derived from [[First Magicians|the same being]]. When they used their untrained magic abilities to transmute themselves on a spiritual level, there was a distinct deviation that created the elves, who have this ability inherently, existing as comfortably without the notion of form and balance as with it. In perhaps not-misleading terms, [[magic]] itself took on its own shape. 

Deeply attuned with the base [[Elemental energy|elemental energies]] of the world, an elf often feels the affects of differences in the [[air]] more than most. A fey's aspect of magic is such that it is transported through their genetics and is afflicted by the environmental [[logic]], similar to dragons, which is why different sorts of elves exist: different sorts of magic do as well. 

It is said that elves dwell on every plane, as their propensity for the arcane leads them on journeys of indulgence and creation. 

# In Society
Elves and other creatures have mingled in harmony for centuries, although the elves' often-held "holier than thou" attitude, due to their lengthy age and other difficult-to-reconcile differences, means there is always something of a barrier between themselves and others. 

In ancient times, such as in the civilization of [[Ith'Paraan]], elves sometimes acted as slave-masters who used shorter-lived races as expendable labor. Modern elves recognize the connotations these biases and histories hold, and push to reform it and adapt it, something the famously inflexible elves can struggle to get across. 

Elven societies often exist without the delineation between genders and sexes, though elves have a perceived social obligation to possess a gender / defined-sex if that is normal in the surrounding culture, something that often feels arbitrary to an elf on the outside.

Elves have developed the complex yet beautiful language of [[Mänyya]].

# Sub-types
## High elves
Commonly called **high elves**, the ***hidarin*** are elves associated with hierarchy and governance, possessing a unique charisma, often born near a powerful source of elemental [[fire]]. They're said to be borne of [[divination]]. 

High elves often have additional features to their bodies, such as extra eyes, fingers, or joints, with some even exercising hyperflexibility. Their sun-kissed skin has a broad range of tones from silvery to pale orange, and is often described to be as smooth as marble. Half-hidarin possess their elven parentage's extra eyes or fingers, and typically have enhanced “eagle vision” or flexibility.

The most radiant high elves are known as **ciendarin** or **sun elves**, said to possess an otherworldly beauty and affinity for [[Light (property)|Light]]. 

## Wood elves
Commonly called **wood elves**, the ***lodarin*** are elves who have a traditional penchant for surviving difficult odds, often born near a powerful source of elemental [[earth]] or [[wood]]. They were said to be created originally by study of [[enchantment]]. 

Their bodies are toughened and keen-sighted, often possessing traits of elemental chaos, such as animalistic tails and horns. Wood elf communities are often found constructed congruously with the environment they find themselves in, leading to a perpetual association with treehouses. 

Wood elves have natural defenses and properties which are equal parts good at fending off parasites and excellent places for life to be furnished. Many wood elves use their bodies as functional gardens as a matter of cosmetic and functional bio-jewelry: for example, having flowers on one's shoulders, vines or fungi growing up and down the limbs, or stylized lichen for hair. A particularly tough wood elf might develop bark over their skin for defense.

Half-lodarin share in their elven parentage's concord with nature: some seem to grow plants simply by walking, some have tails, some have photo-reflective eyes, and other traits, defending on the shape of their [[fylgja]].

## Sea elves
Commonly called **sea elves** or **triton**, the ***merquarin*** are elves traditionally empowered by a nearby powerful source of elemental [[water]], be that a [[Weather|weather]] pattern in a skysea, or a significant lake or watersea. Typically born with tails, and with fanciful hair, the birth of a sea elf is often seen as a blessing by a community, as there is a superstition that, with their noted ability to bend water, they may be able to control the weather. Sea elves are said to be created originally by the study of [[conjuration]].

Sea elves, and half-merquarin as well, are often characterized as regal and elegant, and depending on their climate are more or less flexible: for example, a warm-climate sea elf would have a high level of flexibility and relatively low resistance and strength, while a cold-climate sea elf would have a high level of strength and a relatively low flexibility. 

Sea elves, sometimes known as triton, assume a myriad of shapes, sizes, and color patterns, often generalized as nearly any patterning seen in [[fish]]. Communities of sea elves exist in extreme environments, such as on the landmasses of [[Archipel]], or wherever their control over environmental water and snow makes them excellent allies.
## Drow

Also called **blue elves** or **dark elves**^[this is considered something of a misnomer, and a bit of a touchy phrase], the **darow'kai** or **drow** are born with skin better suited for low-light environments, typically associated with elemental [[metal]] or [[air]]. Just as magic may exist within [[Light (property)|Light or Darkness]], so too can elves. They are said to be borne of [[illusion]].

This affinity does not prescribe much about the elf, though drow socieities often have matriarchical structures due to their association with [[Ravus]]. Darow'kai and their half-kin have distinctly glowing eyes, and have a skintone which ranges in tint anywhere from a deep navy to the color of a pleasantly clouded sky. However, unlike other elves, darow'kai can easily sunburn, and usually go about protecting themselves in ways that other races may misinterpret as shady.

When a drow is injured and self-heals, their injuries will seem to bend light, like the shadows stitch them up whenever something scabs over.

## Eladrin
The **eladarin**, **prismatic elves**, or **eladrin** as they're commonly known, are elves who are not tied to a specific classical school of magic. Flickering often between emotional extremes, eladrin are colorful in temperament and body, and widely considered by non-eladrin to be unpredictable. 

Eladrin typically assume one of four color-distinct forms, similar to certain types of fey, like [[nymph|nymphs]], who are aligned to specific environments. These forms, aspected with the seasons of the [[Year (unit)|year]], describe specific "mixtures" of the chaos within an elf that grants them certain properties: for example, a winter eladrin might have difficulty warming up, or a summer eladrin might dress in looser clothing or tan easily. Some eladrin and especially half-eladrin have animal traits: tough nails like hooves, sharper teeth, rougher skin, and the like.

Eladrin are considered somewhat rarer than other kinds of elves, but often emerge in heroic lineages, where [[Echo|echoes]] of triumphant, brave, and dramatic actions and personalities manifest themselves in the blood.

### Shadar'Kai
**Shadar'kai**, also known as **gray elves** or **[[Elseworld#Kayal|kayal]] elves**, are a particularly strange and niche ancestry of "colorless" eladrin, suffused with a particular [[void energy|void]] affinity that has granted them audience with Ravus. Endemic to the [[Dark Sea]]'s uncommon remnants and the [[elseworld]], shadar'kai are elusive and strange, said to be borne of [[necromancy]]. 

Like their colorful counterparts, shadar'kai are often emotionally extreme, though in this case it typically manifests as extreme unemotionality: a shadar'kai can find it extremely difficult to speak to a non-shadar'kai, mostly because they heavily rely on bodily movement for social cues. It is rumored that this may have been because of the [[The Signal|antinoise]] which assisted in the struggling state of the elseworld, deafening them to one another at one point.

Shadar'kai, like high elves, have an insight which has granted them additional eyes, sometimes additional limbs. As elves associated with the elseworld, shadar'kai eyes may seem reflective and sorrowful like the [[sky-scrape]] itself, even at the best of times, and their shadows can be a great deal more expressive than the elf they're attached to.

# Half-elf
As one of the most ancient peoples, elves are able to sire children of nearly any other sapient ancestry, children who will possess the same magic natures as themselves. **Half-elves** are a plucky ancestry defined by their dwelling in two worlds, not truly belonging to either one completely. For their duality, half-elves have been known to be prone to searching for new places of belonging, and joining the call of the [[Age of Adventurers]].

Though elven traditionalism frowns upon fraternizing with non-elves for the purpose of finding a family, cultural motion towards acceptance and cooperation have led half-elven peoples to becoming a much more prevalent demographic in the last millennia. 

Humans accept half-elves with some precaution, the same way a person would treat their friend with burgeoning super powers: knowing they will be outlived is not ever an easy thing to accept to any creature. Elves don't necessarily look down on half-elves, but aren't always pleased when they fail to live up to expectation, due to an often-held belief that elves were meant to be kept far from human blood, keeping magic to themselves. 

Half-elves usually inherit something of the abilities or traits typical of all elves, such as their intersexuality, as well as something of their particular elven blood, although the degree to which it manifests varies from person to person.
