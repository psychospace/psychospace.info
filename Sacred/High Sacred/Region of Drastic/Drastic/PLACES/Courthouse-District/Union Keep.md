This tower gives the district of Courthouse its name. Union Keep, also known as Union Jail, Union Tower, and Keep Darmatter, is a large torch-shaped building atop Mount Darmatter in southern [[Drastic]], and acts as both the royal prison and the supreme courthouse of [[Kingdom of Sacred]].

Trials in Sacred are aided by [[Cefal]] the Crownshield, and take place before a jury elected from the public (usually two from each region of Sacred, making a random select of 6) as well as six of the [[Judges of Drastic]] and Cefal herself. Those who must only serve a sentence with no consternations are kept in the depths of the Keep, but those who are particularly dangerous shall be held in the Void of [[Stygian]].

Union Keep is also a fort where the [[Dino Airstyle]] are stationed.
