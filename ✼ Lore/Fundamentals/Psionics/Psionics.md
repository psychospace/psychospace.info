**Psionics** is the fundamental study of [[psychospace]], especially in concerning [[Psychic code|code]] and [[Echo|data]]. It is the parent study of and vitally important to [[magic]]; a student of psionics is a **psionicist**, a **psionic**, or **psychic**.

# Description
Psionics aims to describe all scales of psychospace as a cohesive engine of [[logic]], from collective influences which produce [[Confluence|confluences]], to the individual impact and influence of any one specific [[creature]]. 

Some examples of the [[Psinomenon|psinomena]] studied by psiniocists that include [[Phantasm|phantasmal]] [[gravity]], the bestowal of [[True name (concept)|true names]], the power of [[rune|runes]], or the properties of the [[soul]].

Due to its prevalence and non-specific nature, the term is commonly used in relation to [[magic]] casters whose abilities are effectively uncategorized or unknown, now known as [[Psion|psions]].


# Etymology

The term derives from "psi", a [[Sylvan]] term associated with the [[soul]], derived from "Plo'Si" ([[Oa'Rovi]] for "true divine meaning of [[Soul bond|bonds]]").
