**Antimagic** is the [[Psionics|psionic]] study of counteracting and annihilating the effects of specific [[magic]], creating countermeasures and developing weapons which can disable or disempower magic. 

Much of the study of higher-[[Arcane complexity|complexity]] magic involves studying the means of antimagic accessible to your specific discipline. Ironically, most of the successful efforts to do so are themselves [[Spell|spells]], though sometimes [[Curse|curses]] and invasive [[enchantment]] can perform similar feats. Other types of spells, like [[Cruel spells|cruel spells]], can annihilate magic indirectly, and are considered part of the study of antimagic.

Not many are specialists in the topic of antimagic, and it is considered a field yet to be fully explored. Due to the pervasive nature of [[psychospace]], and the nature of [[Light (property)|Light and Dark]], creating safe-spaces where magic cannot be cast is incredibly difficult a task.

The most classical example of antimagic is the spell [[Counterspell]].
