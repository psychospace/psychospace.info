**Eoremu** is the generally-vilified god of snakes and madness, who is often characterized with betrayal and poison for purely personal goals. It despises the [[Cat Lord]].

An ancient deity that likely existed in the shadows of the new [[Divinity]] rising, Eoremu is said to have risen out of nowhere, and its entanglement with [[The Above]] provided them a challenge against [[Dragon|dragons]]. Their plot to drown the dragons in poison rain backfired, and gave its adversaries the magic blood necessary for passing on their mystical psychic energy. As such Eoremu swore to never again enact a plot that could possibly fail, retreating to the [[Dark Sea]].
