The **Shibboleth of Bullion**, also called “the Shib” for short, is the intergovernmental ruling body of much of the remnant of [[Bullion]], who coordinate in matters of warfare and trade. Comprised of seven nation-states, this collective was founded in the wake of the [[Bullion Civil War]] in [[1055 PT]].

# Membership
There were three founding states, and four additional have been granted full membership status. Its leader, the elected [[Lord President]] of Bullion, is usually the emir of the [[Golden Council]]; the incumbent to the office is [[Margaryda Archegon]].  

The symbol of the Shibboleth is a [tiger lily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilium_lancifolium).

Their membership:
* [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan]] (founding) *under Her Excellency and the authority of the [[Throne of Mana]]*
* [[Emirate of Qaulhain]] (founding) *under her [[Golden Council]] and the Palatial Emira*
* [[Sirrhad]] (founding) *under his [[Archmaester]] and his [[Full Spectrum Hammer]]*
* [[Protectorate of Winifreyad]] (full member, *de facto*) *under the Commissioner and Keepers of [[Karyos]]*
* [[League of Joriele]] (full member) *under the [[Collective of the Northern Passage]]*
* [[Owohain]] (full member) *under her Lord Mayor*
* [[Raghain]] (full member) *under her Knight King and Standard-Bearers*

A number of groups who act with effective autonomy have observer status: 
- [[Blue Cinder Militia]]
- The next up to pine for that position is the [[Kuroki Keiichi]].
