**Siegfried "Vani" Vangher** is the pink-haired dwarvish mayor of the town of [[Rainbow Ridge]]. Folks call him "Strawberry". He's a sort of druid/fighter, but he was mostly self taught in both disciplines, and didn't advance very far. He's perfected his legendary origin story over these many years of life, certainly sanctifying his own political position, but for what that's worth, he isn't taken very seriously nowadays.

Although over 300 years old, Siegfried has been no stranger to battling monsters, once wandering the very hills Rainbow Ridge sits amongst. When the previous mayor, the famed gunslinger human Tugg Longshot, moved away to go on adventures with his gang, Siegfried took over in his stead, as his old grandpap Siegnaile asked him to.

The Vangher clan, a word meaning "Hallowed Hill" in Dwarvish, have lived in these hills long as Vani can remember. A bastard clan deviated from the Vanghers, and took up the mantle of darkness, becoming duergar.
