The **Order of Hope**^[Orden Nadezhdy (Орден Надежды)] is an intergovernmental organization and treaty, based in [[Dom Otdykha|Dom Novogo Mira]], and spans most all the [[Mer de Vide]], including the [[The Shibboleth|Shibboleth]], [[Novo Shindan]], [[Ioyon Dynasty of Gears]], and authorities of [[Archipel]]. 

It was founded to set [laws of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_war), share in the ideals and technologies of peace, enforce and sentence international crime, and share in diplomatic support. 

It was formed in [[1251 PT]] between the [[Great Nortian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], following the [[Dragonic War]], initially organized to work together to ease and reduce the harm caused by the [[Nortian Conspiracy]].
