**Zero Day** was a major event on the [[1251 PT#3-3-1251|Third to Nones of Terze]] in [[1251 PT]]. The close of the formal [[Dragonic War]], this 24-hour period saw the rescue of [[Lazuli Dino]], the death of the leadership of the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], the retrieval of [[Bianca Nortia]], and the assumption of [[Serena Nortia]] as [[Empress of Nortia]]. 

Throughout the [[Mer de Vide]], it is the day that the [[S4]] became legends. 

Most know it as the day the [[sky-scrape]] was etched and the [[Elseworld]] became apparent, after which a number of changes befell [[the Planet]], including the [[Umbraid]] and the [[Väräh]] beginning to return to [[the Heavens]].

Some believe it was the day that the [[End Times]] began, as shortly thereafter [[new magic]] began to spread like wildfire.
