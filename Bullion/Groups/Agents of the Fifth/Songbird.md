A **songbird** are a general term which refers to [[Broadcaster|Broadcasters]] and [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturges]] in the employ of (or sometimes simply sympathetic to) the [[Fifth Institute]] in [[Bullion]].

Their school of chivalry, called *Plainsong*, derives from a longstanding tradition of religious [[Reclamation (Bullion)|reclamation]] being first step in rehabilitation of criminals throughout [[The Shibboleth]].

The [[Single-Brain Cell|SBC]] call them “Brims” for their braces (usually around the neck or leg), usually forged out of magic-resistant material like [[brimstone]].
