Also called "The Shimmering Justicar", **Prus** is [[Divinity|goddess]] of empowerment, order, and righteousness, as well as presiding over the metallic dragons and being a patron saint of any kings, queens, or rulers of lands.

A true child of [[Athemat]], Prus is largely considered a goddess of justice as well, but her work in this pantheon is more as a "judge" than as a figure of justice herself. In other words, she is not a lawmaker, but rather an enforcer.
