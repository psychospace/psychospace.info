**Plesio Pobeda Falknjir**, known as the Great Bandit King, was the first king of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], famously conquering and seizing the [[Carapa Republic]]. A human, it is also well known that he founded the swordschool later inherited and evolved by [[House Dino]], though he himself was not a member of this bloodline.

He married [[Memoria di Alato]], and together had a daughter, [[Brachi Falknjir]], who succeeded him to the throne.

He passed away in [[784 PT]] at the age of 110.
