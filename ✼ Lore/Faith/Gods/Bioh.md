**Bioh**^[pronounced [BYOH], rhyming with "Kyo"], also known as the **Mother of Life**, is the [[divinity|goddess]] of nature, navigation, and evolution, a daughter of [[Cientia]] in the [[pantheon of Dawndust]]. 

She is the [[Divinity#Alignment|chaotic good]] guardian deity of [[Elf|elvenkind]]. To them, in [[Mänyya]] she is known as *Señora Verde*, the **Green Lady**.

 Bioh is said to have sired daughters with [[Calcula]], her twin; these are [[Lex]] and [[Ordo]], per the mythos of the [[Folly of the Twins]].


# Mythology
As with many of the early pantheon, little is known for sure of the Green Lady's origin, other than that she emerged from Cientia's responsibilities. Many believe her to be a novel, prehistoric [[creature]] which [[Mortal God Ritual|ascended]] to the task, be they an [[archfey]], [[First Magicians|First One]], or [[jann]]. What almost all sources agree on is that the Mother of Life, vanguard of mortalkind, did not start off [[immortal]].

Bioh's "first steps" on [[the Planet]] are said to have been taken on the remnant known later as [[Bullion]], as the remnant possessed ancient life in spades. Immediately following the creation of her [[domain]], [[chaos]] on the planet began to take clearer shape, defined along axioms originally spoken aloud by the Remembered World. 

These intentions, writ into the [[Divine Equation]], collectively took shape as an aspect of the [[Golden Voice]], known as **Pri'Mord**, sometimes translated as the "First Lifegiver" or "First Soul". As Pri'Mord took root, nature was given conditions in which it was allowed to thrive.

Until the [[The Gathering|Gathering]], [[Immortal|immortals]] still exerted a large amount of control over mortal day-to-day existence. The Mother of Life's initial domain consisted of controlling and directing the rampant outpouring of [[vitality energy]] from the wells of [[Mana (plane)|Mana]], which was uncontrolled by the [[Vorgon'vor|First Death]].  Through her intervention with this flow, [[Echo|echoes]] began to agglomerate together, and [[Soul|souls]] started to form. Every creature on the Planet, in one way or another, owes Bioh their lives. 


# Ideology
Bioh is said to possess an insatiable curiosity, perpetually exploring and interrogating new opportunity, as long as it preserves the world around said opportunity. As part of this curiosity, evolution is allowed to naturally take root. Her emotions can seem random and raw, as random and uncontrollable as the [[weather]]: their fury can befall a settlement one moment, then simmer into kind protectiveness.

Her divine icon is that of three leaves overlain, forming a star-like shape. These reflect her three statures, as navigator (north), life-giver (northeast), and life-changer (northwest). She is typically depicted as a [[giant]] figure of verdant skin, whose body is arborous and mighty, her hair the color of storms.

Within the lore of the [[Sleepy Yore]], the Green Lady is the one who put the breath-of-life and the heart-of-invention in the souls of every creature on the Planet, as well as allowing both gods and men to change over time, different from the [[Dragon#Zhill|zhill]] who initially dwelled on the planet.
