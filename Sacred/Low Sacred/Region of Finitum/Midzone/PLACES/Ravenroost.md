**Ravenroost** is where the local [[Victory Starscouts]] reside in [[Midzone]]. 

This odd, almost [[bird]]-shaped sturdy wooden building overlooks the northern border of town and is where many of the guards sleep. It boasts a large stable, but a modest prison, as most of the inmates are shipped off to [[Gateway]] weekly by road to keep them out of the town. Notable for their black cloaks and duster coats, the Ravenroost guards are seen as good people within Scarred Sacred, and many of their number are trusted members of society. The guard are the only citizens of Midzone allowed to carry weapons; the individual citizen's weaponry are kept at the Steel Storehouse west of the Bazaar.

The leader of the Ravenroost is a dark skinned high elven man named [[Jenou Sadon]] with three eyes and graying hair (**LG champion**) who is understanding above all else.
