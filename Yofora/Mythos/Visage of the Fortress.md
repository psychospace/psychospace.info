campaign: "[[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]]"

***Visage of the Fortress*** is a historical-fiction novel written by [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortian]] author [[Václav Nil]]. Its creation and publishing remains something of a mystery, though it has become famous for its use of prose and literary devices to evoke an almost hypnotic feeling in the audience. It has become a fixation of several magical researchers in the years since its publishing.

It was originally published in an epistolary format over [[1237 PT]], distributed in [[Umazia]] by the [[Black Swan Tradesman]], a prolific paper in the region. The work was supposedly submitted without specification if it was fiction or not, with many details that add further layers of obfuscation to the complexity.

# Content
The plot is dense and complex, covering many events political and social which take place over about 174 days in [[1174 PT]]. As a piece of historical fiction, it covers the [[War of the Masters]]. The story jumps naturally from viewpoint to viewpoint, and its themes portray a conflicted empire. The novel shows characters stuck between the desire for learning and enrichment amid wartimes, and how it conflicts with the natural instincts of society and necessity for human connection. It runs over 750 pages in most printings.

The "visage of the fortress" described in the title is an impressionist painting of [[Orkrengrad]], framed above the fireplace in the town pub. In that pub, people go through difficult changes in their life, and where a climactic duel takes place. The title partly symbolizes the desire to change, even when that change is undefined and mired in stories both true and false.

## Anomaly
An anomaly is contained within the contents of the 18th chapter, which was the primary focus of [[Amanita Parasom]]'s fascination with the book. Apparently, it was first documented by a strange scrawl written in a different hand when the 18th chapter was initially submitted for publication.

Replicating the events of the book has a few known steps:
1. In a space inside a building, dim lights and conceal windows. Only up to two creatures should attempt this at a time, and nobody else must know **when** the [[ritual]] is taking place.
2. Without leaving that space, pass through a sequence of seven unique doors, without backtracking or repeating doors, and without reentering rooms. The seventh door **must** exit into the room with the first door.
3. Repeat step 2, over and over. Reality should begin to distort and expand, making the path more treacherous, and lights should begin to darken. Over the course of multiple repetitions, the physical space between the rooms will make less and less sense. Entities beyond understanding might emerge or be vaguely manifested. If a loop is ever aborted or failed, the anomaly will collapse, and potentially kill or permanently change the people inside.
4. After 10 repetitions, you will enter "a space which was previously disconnected from reality".

The anomaly is a pervasive influence on how [[Psychospace]] overlays the [[Wild Blue Yonder]], acting as a route and natural entrypoint into [[The Fortress]].

It is believed by Amanita that the author of *Visage* did not experience more than five iterations.

### Passage

In this chapter, the viewpoint character, the elf singer Anyah, returns to her childhood home for the first time since the war and begins to feel quite strange. Her twin sister, Meshulah, acts as her counterpoint as the sense of ennui and nostalgia slowly overwhelms them both, walking through the rooms cyclically. They appear to both become quite sick by the process as space distorts. When chapter 19 begins, a time jump occurs, and the contents of chapter 18 are not mentioned again explicitly.

>“We used to live here,” said Anyah, her breath haggard and slow. She turned to her twin sister as if seeing her for the first time. “How could I have forgotten? I want to walk through its halls again. Know this place. Know myself. Burn all of me, all of here, into my memory." 
><br>Meshulah protested, “But what of me? This place is not ours anymore. We forsook it. We are so much older than we were when this place was our home. Why etch a time we tried to forget into our skin?”
><br>Anyah smiled softly, forlorn without fully realizing why. “Without the doors inside our minds, without our steps regressed, we will never fully understand what we walk for, or where we are going. The path to the heart must be laid bare in its totality if we are to achieve perfection.”

In chapter 29, the penultimate chapter, Anyah is shot dead, and her last words reference [[Death]] as "just another door in the fortress, just a door to wherever it is we're going". This is the only other clear allusion to the events of chapter 18.
