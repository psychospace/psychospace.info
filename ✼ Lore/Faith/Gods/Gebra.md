**Gebra**, the Herald Truth, is the a [[divinity|godly]] son of [[Athemat]], guardian of [[Kobold|kobolds]], and divine overseeing mythos, fear, and communication. A patron god of stories, Gebra is primarily concerned with mythos and preparedness, ensuring that no step is taken without precaution.

As mythology goes, his body was made from the deceased, prior body of [[Mynos]], slain by the actions of [[Prus]]. As its form collapsed onto [[The Above]], its ichor fell through the [[Plane|realms]] as a [[Weather|hurricane]] of [[soulstone|soulstones]], which formed the core of kobold origins. With the [[domain]] of the past essentially forsaken by its [[Arizhmiya|previous keeper]], it fell to Gebra, granted a vestige soul by its father and sister, to venerate and collate what could still be collated. Once this body had ascended, the ability for sapient creatures to remember long-term ideas and events was reinstated to the world.

Due to Gebra's awakening, many snake-like creatures in the world like his sister are said to molt and be reborn with each shed skin, making fear an infinite foe. It is said that this is why kobolds are often subjugated by other evil races, due to tying his fate to a snake, and thus inadvertently to the hidden mights of [[Eoremu]].
