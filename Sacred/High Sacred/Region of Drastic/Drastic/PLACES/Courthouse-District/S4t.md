The **S4t**^[(*ess-fort*)] is the base of the [[S4]]. 

It used to be the older home of some [[House Burgitsk]] family members that was later vacated in [[1243 PT]] for [[Gekth√∫s|their new property]] in [[The Well]]. Previously known as the **Beatific Keep**, it fell under [[House Dino]]'s control after, and was left vacant until Prince [[Lazuli Dino|Lazuli]] gifted the keep to the S4.
