The **tailed stranger** was a mysterious presence, claiming to be an [[omen]], which appeared during the final moments of [[Zero Day]] to the [[S4]]. Its[^1] true identity is unknown.

It claimed to be "proof" of the party's success, incapable of overwriting it.


# History
Prior to its appearance, disturbances had been occurring at the [[Nail of Nortia]] and surrounding [[Serena Nortia]] for the two weeks prior. In particular, a phantom presence had repeatedly appeared in relation to both subjects, seeking something.

By the time of [[Scarla Nitrum]]'s death, it fully manifested during the etching of the [[sky-scrape]], seemingly freezing time in place while it was so. Shortly after arriving, it appeared to recognize when and where it had appeared, freaking out, and apparently heard[^2] from an unknown source, speaking possessively and obsessively, that "she[^3] is *our* enemy".

Apparently, it had arrived from the future to kill the S4, all in service of a goal to "save the world". However, due to a rarely-observed[^4] element of [[logic]], the gun it drew on the frozen adventurers was [unable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_protection_conjecture) to [[Reality-Bending|alter reality]], appeared to misfire seven separate times, and failed to erase them. Its last shot was [fired backwards into the roof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloping) of the Nail of Nortia, cracking open the brick. It expressed regret for its actions.

The stranger then conveyed a number of things to the party.

## Time Travel
According to its own words, [[1251 PT]] was ten years before its "vessel" "came to be". It also referred to having been "sent" to that time, and if it only obeyed "what they ask", it would allow its painful life to hold meaning. The stranger returned to its home-timeframe when its "clock resets", likely referring to the device around its leg. 

It was determined later by an investigation led by Serena and [[Arthur Graywell|Arthur]] that, according to its words, actions, and appearance, the figure was likely of [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qauli]] ethnicity, a [[ganzi]] [[human]] teenager and [[psion]]. Its "home timeframe" was likely dated to the mid-1270s. It is ultimately unknown [[#Abilities and Notoriety|how]] it reached 1251 PT, nor what its device did to return it to its home timeframe.


# Appearance
Its physical appearance was that of a teenage [[human]] person of unknown gender. It was some form of [[chaos]]-kin, given the tail of blue-white scales and pinkish feathers which extended from its lower back. Its skin was brown, and its hair was past shoulder-length, tinted a deep crimson. Peculiarly, a part of its hair appeared to be comprised of feathers.[^2]

Its outfit was comprised of a black hat and cardigan over a traditional pink [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qauli]] dress with a gold and cerulean belt, and brown combat boots. It wore glasses, though its left eye was obscured, as though it were an eyepatch. Seven necklaces, arranged to resemble the orbit-paths of the [[Antic Sea]], adorned its neck. On its right ankle was a strange metallic device, which appeared to allow it to return whence it came.

# Abilities and Notoriety
The tailed stranger indicated an ability to effect [[time travel]], an impossibly rare occurrence. In all known history, the tailed stranger is the only creature to have demonstrated taking conscious actions in a [[context]] before its own lifespan, rendering it an unprecedentedly unusual case. 

It was theorized by the investigation this possibility emerging may have something to do with the destruction of the artifact of [[Arizhmiya]], which occurred only a few moments prior to the stranger's full arrival.


[^1]: From an out-of-universe [[⎋ Real-World|meta perspective]], the stranger is referred to with singular it/its/itself pronouns for the purposes of clarity. In-universe, the stranger did not self-reference with any pronouns, nor could the stranger's gender be determined; the stranger also intermittently referred to itself in the plural sense.
[^2]: Given the brevity of its appearance, and the freezing of time, the stranger could not be questioned on any details of these elements.
[^3]: Likely [[Serena Nortia]].
[^4]: A similar self-consistency or self-existence principle is the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] component of the story of [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]], whose [[Amakudari's phantom|phantom]] warned itself not to return to the planet: which itself defied, leading to its phantom's travel, and so on.
