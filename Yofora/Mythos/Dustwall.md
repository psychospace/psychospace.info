'The **Dustwall** is a stormy phenomenon which surrounds [[Yofora]]. According to the [[Temple of the Uforiad]], the wall was originally created by a protective "gravity" which originated from [[Valerian]], which manifested in his descendants as an affectation for [[The Sheer]].

Made up of a conflagration of [[Elemental energy]], axiomatically earth and air focused, the Dustwall is comprised of a heavy sandstorm which surrounds the remnant at most points, the static electricity of which causes regular lightning storms. The wall blots out much of [[Cien]]'s energy and light, and protects from invaders, though it allows those aboard a [[Airship#Steelclad|steelclad airship]] to leave and enter freely.
