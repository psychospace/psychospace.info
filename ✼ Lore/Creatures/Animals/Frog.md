A **frog**, sometimes called a **toad**, is a small amphibian [[creature]] with four legs, found throughout the Heavens. Many varieties of frog exist, but they are broadly associated with magical [[Transmutation|transmutation]], sickness, [[Elemental energy|elemental water]], and the god [[Eoremu]].

Like [[bird|birds]], there is a general deviation between frogs which nest in [[Cloudscape|cloud]] versus those which dwell on land and [[water]]. The adaptability of frogs is part of the reason it has been able to spread so far, to the point that frogs, though rarely, have been known to [[Weather|rain]] from the sky.

Many frogs are poisonous, manifesting curiously when interacting with [[magic]]. This natural defense of frogs causes some to grow to grotesque sizes, able to devour a [[human]] as easily as their smaller kin can swallow insects.

# Frogs in culture
Frogs are associated widely with magic. They make for a common form of [[Familiar|familiar]], since capturing one is an easy task, and many a [[Wizardry|wizard]] who binds one to their service grows into a nostalgic fondness for the creatures. Something about the nature of frogs, being such easy and common prey, allows a caster to revel in how far they have come since their first days in their practice.

As companions of casters like [[Witchcraft|witches]], frogs become associated with a variety of superstitions. One of the most infamous [[Curse|curses]] attributed in the Heavens was one which corrupted a careless trade-prince of [[Archipel]] into a frog.

The legs of edible frogs are both a delicacy in certain parts of the world, and a commonly-known reagent used in [[Alchemy|alchemy]].
