**Shadowtongue** is a colloquial [[Shindani]] name given to the most-common spoken language by [[Elseworld#Kayal|kayals]] for communication throughout the [[elseworld]]. Developed over several hundred years and still slowly spreading to this day, Shadowtongue originated as a creole of [[Infernal]], [[Draconic]], and [[Nortian (language)|Inner Nortian]], specifically of the dialects spoken within [[Else-Orkrengrad]].

Some six-hundred years after the [[TPK]], the language is almost unintelligible with its origins, though many words and fragments of grammar recur. Though writing systems for Shadowtongue exist, written communication outside of archival is seen as redundant inside the elseworld due to the dangers present, especially [[Nightshade|nightshades]].
