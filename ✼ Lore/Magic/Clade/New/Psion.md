A **psion**^[SIGH-ahn] or **psychic** is well-established term for a caster whose abilities deviate from norms, or whose [[magic]] defies common delineations. It is also used in current day as a generic term for a [[New Magic|new magic]] caster. 

The portmanteau (of “[[scion]]” and “[[psionics]]”) began use centuries prior to the [[Dragonic War]]. All clades of new-magician are considered various flavors of psion, such as [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturges]] or [[Witchcraft|witches]].
