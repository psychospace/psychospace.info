An **airship** or **airboat** is any vessel capable of flight and travel across the [[Skysea|sky-oceans]] of [[The Heavens]], powered by a [[Core engine|core engine]] and tenuously bonded to [[Gravity|gravity]]. Mostly constructed of wood and generally massive, airships are hardy and require a high degree of experience and resources to manage, construct, and pilot.

Airships are housed, repaired, and deployed from locations known as **ports** or **docks**. A ship's crew is comprised of many roles, the most chief of which is **captain**, a person who pilots and takes responsibility for the ship's crew, cargo, and safety. 

# Categories
Aside from the intentions of various classes of airship, some airships can be broadly defined by their unique features. 

## Amphibious
An **amphibious** airship is capable of traversing both sky-oceans and [[water]]-oceans, useful for conditions such as dense [[Cloudscape|clouds]]. While most airships can support both means of transportation, due to similar means of propulsion, amphibious airships are designed for jobs which can only be done with both in mind.

Most amphibious airships are constructed in [[Archipel]], a remnant whose water composition makes them desirable. Amphibious ships are also used widely in [[Fish|fishing]] in order to secure certain kinds of prey. 
## Steelclad
A **steelclad** airship is one whose armor is forged of the metal [steel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel), a form of reinforced alloyed iron. 

These airships usually require more than one core to stabilize them and a slow top speed, both due to the weight of the ship, but this is offset by impressive defense and durability compared to wood.

Steelclad ships are constructed at special drydocks known as **swan forges**, named for the shape of the foundry where the armor is formed. Most swan forges have been constructed in [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] and the empire's allies (as of [[1251 PT]]).

## Supraekeic
A **supraekeic**^[Pronounced [sou-pra-eh-kay-ick]. From "supra", meaning "transcendent", and "ekei", meaning "[[The Planet#^b65a40|threshold]]".] airship, sometimes also called a **chthonic** or **kermic** ship, is able to survive atypical [ambient pressures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure) usually caused by severe ascent or descent. 

Such ships are designed for regular travel between layers of the [[The Planet#Planar stack|planar stack]]. A supraekeic craft is ultimately designed to avert or protect against [dysbarism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysbarism) in its crew and passengers, especially if the ship is constantly on the move, such as in the case of ships built for hunting, mining, or fishing.

The construction of supraekeic craft is novel, rare, and usually industrial in nature. For much of their existence, airships designed to travel between layers have provided with redundant "strip-parts" which are designed to protect utilitarian armor from corrosion, by being "stripped off" from the forces acting upon an airship, while descending to a lower layer. 

Such craft are typically described as being capable of **infrayonder** (below the [[Wild Blue Yonder|Yonder]]) or **interyonder** (above the Yonder) travel.

# History
## Pre-shipflight
It is believed that [[First Magicians]] originally tamed or allied themselves with [[Dragon|dragons]] for the task of flight. For almost all [[âœ¼ Timeline Hub|history]], various creatures of [[The Above]] were worked for the task of personal flight.

The first airship, a vessel specifically created to ferry passengers across the skyseas, was probably constructed in the period around 15,000 to 10,000 years ago, though several civilizations had tamed dragons and traveled the skies in limited capacities beforehand.

In the era of [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Paraan]], [[Witchcraft|witches]] known as void farers were able to use their [[Gift (witchcraft)|connection]] to their patron to mimic the role performed by cores today, able to raise islands and use them as vessels. Some myths state that the area now known as the [[Wabi Steppe]] was a mined location for these islands. This goal was the ambition of its founder, [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]].

Elsewhere, [[Wraithsword|wraith weapons]] were utilized by the native peoples of the [[Colossal Ocean]] to conduct trade with one another.

## Discovery of modern cores
The discovery of cores occurred in around [[BPT 50]].

![[BPT 50#Origin of airships|no-h]]

During the Scaled Purge, due to the difficulty of hunting chromatics, the [[Quasidragon|quasidragon]] was first created, leading to the Purge's end. 

Spurred by cores, [[Dawndust]]'s newfound aerial fleets began to spread their teachings diplomatically, spreading their [[Shindani|language]] and their [[Pantheon of Dawndust|beliefs]] across the [[Mer de Vide]], and often deals and trades with other nations would introduce airships elsewhere. Ships thus quickly rose in prominence across the entirety of the [[The Planet|planet]].

## Innovations
Due to the natural resources of [[Yofora]] and [[Umazia]], the [[Great Nortian Empire]] created the first steelclad ships to escape the [[Dustwall]].

Around the [[6th century PT]], the [[Filistec|filistec]] was invented, the first true anti-airship weapon.

In [[1243 PT]], the [[Runic engine]] was invented in Nortia.

# Weaponry
Up until the [[11th century PT|turn of the millennium]], airships themselves usually did not often have weaponry, with the crew and the design of the ship itself being the primary defenses. 

Following primarily fielded ramming weapons, thrown alechmist's fire, or lacerating spiked poles.  The most powerful weapon a government could keep at the time was a court magician, and one would often be deployed on each vessel in a fleet, effectively responsible for the crew's success: the rest of its arsenal would be that used by the crew.

With the advent of cannonry, **gunships** became terrific threats.
