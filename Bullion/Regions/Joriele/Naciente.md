The **Naciente Forest Preserves** (pronounced *[nah-shien-tay]*) is a large region of well-protected land inside [[League of Joriele|Joriele]] that has historically and presently been occupied by several distinct native villages (largely comprised of various [[Kinfolk|Kinfolk]]), individually **Naciente nations**. The [[MÃ¤nyya]] term means "nascent, untouched".

# Structure

Similar to the [[Protectorate of Winifreyad|Protectorate]], the [[Treaty of Siete Sangres]] (the *Seven Bloods*) prevents conflict and assures mutual collaboration and trade between all peoples of Naciente. Large sections of the outlying lands, as well as the entirety of the nations themselves, are protected land, unable to be legally invaded or aggressed by any group. 

Unlike Winifreyad, though, this land is assured to be safeguarded in the hands of the individual peoples within, rather than ruled by a conglomerate government.

Each recognized nation of Naciente must appoint a Speaker who carries the will of their protector (be that a *kami* or other kind of god). The Speaker is usually the current leader of each settlement, but in special circumstances one may be appointed temporarily. A Speaker of Naciente is also, incidentally, represented through a liaison as a Lord of the Northern Passage.

# History
During the times of [[Ith'Paraan]], many cultures were chased from these lands. During the late [[Bullion#Third Era|Third Era]], as they were being resettled after the [[Os'Grun]] impact event, these lands were upset by minor wars in the region, displacing many peoples across the remnant. The Forest Preserve system as it exists today was put into place around the turn of the current millennium in [[963 PT]], and has largely remained undisturbed since, later influencing the shape of the [[League of Joriele]] as a whole and even [[The Shibboleth]].
