The **Witch-King**, real name **Roman Mira**, was a high-profile [[Elf|elven]] criminal [[Witchcraft|warlock]] in [[Bullion]], a major kingpin. He kept various gangs in his pocket through various acts of coercion, and his family and those inspired by him remain active threats to this day. 

His own gang, the [[Callous Few|Callous Few]], he treated extremely well (though for traitors, they were treated extremely viciously). The gang was later incorporated as an organ of the [[Geladoe cartel]], said to have spawned partly from [[Doe|a lieutenant of the Witch-King]].

He was most well known for his weapon, what the press of the day called "[[Sparking smoke]]", foretold by his eyes and blackened, charred limbs: his eyes did not look dissimilar to [[Aingeru Ariessus]]'. Since his capture, he has become something of a legendary character. His most prominent and used stronghold was [[Thunder-Fork Temple]].

# History
It's said that before his reign of terror, he was some kind of student of one of the [[Institutes of Bullion]] who went mad after uncovering a deadly secret.  

Though most notable for eventually kidnapping [[Ithibela Rysae|Rico]], heir to the [[Luminaria]], his reign of terror was long, and there were many attempts to bring him in or stop his magical experiments, illicit trade, or nefarious minions. 

He was eventually captured in around [[1194 PT]].
## Legacy
To this day, though he has been inactive (either captured or killed) for over 40 years, people still say that the land within range of the Thunder-Fork still might be struck by his dreaded lightning, still might be [[Curse|cursed]] with whatever the bastard left behind. Many places of holy repute, especially in [[Emirate of Qaulhain|Qaulhain]], remain haunted by his presence, still placing wards and non-magic talismans to act as advance warning against the threat of the sparking smoke.
