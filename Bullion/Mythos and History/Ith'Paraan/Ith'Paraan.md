**Ith'Paraan** (*ith-pahr-ahn*, *demonym: Ith'Par*) was an ancient diarchy, founded in the [[Bullion#Third Era|third era]] of [[Bullion]] by inhabitants of [[The Above]]. Ruins of theirs have been discovered all over the area surrounding [[Mount Sokron]] and the [[Ithika River Valley]], all the way into the [[Siella Valley]] and further outlying regions.

# History
*See also: [[◍ Legend of Amakudari]].*

Ith'Paraan was founded and ruled over by [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto]], a legendary [[Dragon|dragon]] who wished to share its [[Gift of Stars|Gift]] with others, at cost to itself. Amakudari's pontiff, a position in its worship which changed hands from epoch to epoch, would also serve as an important ruler of the nation.

Ruled by a caste of [[owlin]], [[tengu]], and [[Elf|elven]] peoples, they tinkered with life through the application of natural laws and magic, creating beasts like [[owlbears]] to act as enforcers, while discarding mistakes like [[Chimera|chimera]] to the corners of their hallowed lands. The [[Harengon]] and [[anadi]] societies of the [[Siella Valley]] was coerced through force to operate as slaves and spies for Ith'Par aristocrats.

These people tamed flying beasts for work and lifting, built huge clockwork constructs (now known as [[Copperbeast|copperbeasts]]) for protection, and traveled the stars in vessels known as [[Void Breaker|void breakers]]. Apparently thanks to this affinity with the [[Dark Sea]], unearthed Ith'Par technology far surpasses the complexity of that of the modern world's.
## Miserable Age
Their society fell in a dramatic, mythic fashion when they attempted to forge a society on another world: when Amakudari attempted to buck destiny. In this mass exodus, known as the "[[Ith'Alnna]]" ("exultation of the storm") Project, afflicted those left behind with a strange plague known as "[[Angel's cough]]". 

This outbreak caused most of the society to fall after Amakudari's [[Amakudari's phantom|Promise]] to itself was fulfilled. The rest of the society was endangered further of being swept into obscurity by a series of natural disasters, which upended the ground and dried the rivers.

This ultimately culminated in an epochal meteor impact in the modern [[Wabi Steppe]], called "the [[Os'Grun]]" ("wandering fist"), said to have been caused by the [[Divinity|gods]]' outrage at the society's hubris and insubordination. This effectively eradicated almost all of Ith'Paraan's population. It is said that these cascading events also led to the reputation of [[Tarnation]].

The land was eventually reclaimed by [[Elf|elven]] conquistadors from [[Archipel]] in the [[Bullion#Fourth Era|Fourth Era]], eventually leading to the modern-day [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|AIP]].
