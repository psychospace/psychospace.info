The **League of Joriele** is a coalition of smaller or one-time nation-states in the northeast of [[Bullion]], along and nearby a striking mountain range called [[the Chirag]]. 

The range separates many of the people by poorly or dangerously accessible routes, leading to burgeoning air-and-land nomadic trade unions. Together, this land has historically been known as the **Northern Passage** for this reason.

In the region of Joriele is the oldest life on the remnant: one example is an old-growth wooded region known as the [[Naciente]], and holdouts from when almost everything else was wiped out when the [[Os'Grun]] impact occurred. 

The nations of Joriele generally stay apart and separately operating but united under a flag, which grants the independent states membership and at least “voting shares” in [[The Shibboleth]] through a group called the _Lords of the Northern Passage_.
