>[!question|bg-c-blue ttl-c] This is the astronomical and ontological concept. You might be looking for "[[The Heavens]]" or "[[The Planet]]", the significant pieces of the universe described on this wiki.
---

The **[universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe)** is all of [[Out There|space]] and [[time]], and their contents. The universe is governed by general rules known as [[logic]], as well as fundamental forces, like [[chaos]] and [[gravity]], which form what [[Soul|souls]] experience as **reality**. These rules are further reinforced and redefined by entities which permeate existence, such as [[Divinity|gods]] or [[Outsider|Outsiders]].

The universe encompasses all that is "**existence**", and [[the Heavens]] is but a small part of it, its people unable to truly fathom its breadth. To [[Reality-Bending|bend reality]] is to alter its logic to your will, though the vast power and immensity of the universe can cause repurcussions.

# Composition
The universe is deconstructed into [[Plane|planes]], individual levels and states of existence which create one another and offer meaning and limitations to one another. Each is considered more "real" than the levels below it, and thus can influence the dimensions which precede it.

The physical world, typical reality, is known as [[Manifold Seas]] or "the manifold universe". The Heavens's small piece of it is known as the [[Antic Sea]], or more specifically, [[the Planet]].

The vast majority of the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe) is known to the Heavens as the [[Out There]]. The [[Plane#Pyrean|pyrean planes]] (or, at least, the one that is known, [[Kibangan]]) create regions of influence throughout the Out There by linking with [[star|stars]]. 

For reasons they cannot cleanly articulate, most of the cosmos the Heavens can observe defies what logic they have come to expect. This space is known as [[Chartless Sea#Chartlessness|chartless seas]].
