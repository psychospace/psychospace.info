An **aberration** is a common [[Shindani]] term for any being whose origin is to be found in the [[Out There]], such as [[Outsider|Outsiders]] or their creations like [[aboleth]]. They are termed thus because they are "aberrations" in standard [[logic]] as it is expected to have on [[the Planet]].

[[Imagi]] is said to be the deity which oversees aberrations.
