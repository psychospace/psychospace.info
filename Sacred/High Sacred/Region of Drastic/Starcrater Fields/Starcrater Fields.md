The **Starcrater Fields** are the name given to the plains outside of Drastic, many of which are marked with five-pointed craters.

When [[Plesio Falknjir]] took over the [[Carapa Republic]], it was said he saw a star fall from the sky in these lands. The craters, and the [[Power star|power star]] he saw hit the earth here, became symbols of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. It is also said that this is where he learned of the phrase 'victory eternal', written in the stars.
