The **Vault of Foreknowledge**, also sometimes called the Fountainhead, is a well-defended holy site within [[Stygian]]. It became part of the [[Carapa Republic|Carapaean]] Contingency, acting as a lock for [[Aet'Caldwyn]].

It is the [[ritual]] site where, originally, [[Golorr]] was bound to its stone, as well as where it was initially spawned at the dawn of this world. 

Etched into one wall of a massive cavern is a glittering emerald [sun stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_sun_stone), upon which the evangels etched their history. It was this stone that the Golorr Stone was carved from. The sun stone dams a massive body of water connected to the [[Grand Watersea]].

It was eventually burst open by the [[S4]] in the course of learning the truth behind the [[dragonic curse]].

# Purpose
As part of the Contingency, it was designed to act as a stasis chamber, sequestering twenty [[Evangel|evangels]], interred in crystal, including daughters to [[Aso ar'Carapa]] **Urthr**^[[[Old Duer]] for "fate"], **Verthandi**^[Old Duer for "happening"], and **Skuld**^[Old Duer for "debt" or "certainty"]. Of these twenty mentioned, only eighteen managed to be fully hidden during the preparations of the Contingency (missing [[Certain (evangel)|Skuld]], who fled to [[Archipel]], and one other, likely Aso themselves).

As part of hiding away, the evangels were divested of their holy graces, [[Crystal preservation|preserving them in crystal]] until those graces were returned to them.

This would ensure the survival of some part of the dynasty, and, along with the [[Gold piece|gold]] in the [[Vault of Foretelling]], would result in its revival.
