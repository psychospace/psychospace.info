The [[Kuroki Keiichi|black-trees]]'s furtive leader, named **Kuroki**, is a secretive individual rumored to be over two thousand years old. 

From Kurokiâ€™s grove, said to be somewhere in the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]], comes regular gifts of astral sap, a reagent which can be treated to produce items like bags of holding, which the Keiichi use well. The tribes have occasionally needed to go to authority figures they usually distrust when vigils transporting the astral sap are attacked in the mountains.
