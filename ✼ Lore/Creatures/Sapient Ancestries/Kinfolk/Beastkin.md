**Beastkin**, sometimes called **shifters** or **therians**, are a vast yet rare #sapient heritage of [[Kinfolk]] who possess ties to natural energy through their blood and through their [[Fylgja|fylgja]]. The term specifically refers to anybody who is gifted with an animal form, partial or total, which does not conflict with their non-kin humanoid side.

This connection is such that they possess the positive attributes of the [[Primal curse]] and *almost* none of the negative attributes. Their alternate form, known as their **spirit form**, can grant them unique powers. Pure beastkin are rarer and rarer, though they are known to spontaneously come about in areas strongly tied to nature. Many beastkin can trace their ancestry back to some event related to [[the Beastlands]] or to [[Umazia]], both places dense with [[Vitality energy|positive energy]]. 

When someone with the primal curse has a child, that child is likely to be born at least partly therian, inheriting the primal curse. A therian may be born to any ancestry which can contract the primal curse. There is no way to "cure" a therian of its gifts. However, death and [[Resurrection]] may weaken their ties to their fylgja.
