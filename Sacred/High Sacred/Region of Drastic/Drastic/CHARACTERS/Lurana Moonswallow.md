![[âŽ‹ Needs Rewrite]]
Also known as "Ana", **Lurana Moonswallow** is an old member of [[Critical Hit]].

A [[tiefling]]-[[human]], Lurana is an old alchemist whose memory issues betray her mastery of cocktails. A founding member of Critical Hit who was viciously defeated before even the Platinum Boulder was defeated, giving her memory issues and knocking her out of their lineup.

Currently operates the [[Oldwall Pub]], one of Critical Hit's first properties that they received for their accomplishments in their first adventure. Should she ever need to fight again, her axe is waiting for her (literally) in its case on the second floor.
