**High Sacred**, historically known as **Carapa**, is a [[remnant]], technically one half of a single remnant shattered by the [[Breaking of Sacred]]. Its [[Flipside|flipside]] is [[Mount Celestia]]. Its counterpart is [[Low Sacred]]. 

The many unique features of the remnant offer many boons to its people, especially the [[Grand Watersea]]. High Sacred was the home of about 903,230 people as of [[1251 PT]].

The [[Kingdom of Sacred]] rules here.

High Sacred is split into three duchies:
- **Grander**, headquartered in [[Miraclesfield]]
- [[Drastic]], headquartered in the city of the same name
- [[Toride]], headquartered in the city of the same name

It also is bordered by the [[Queen's Isle]] to the northwest.
