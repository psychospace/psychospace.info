The **Vault of Foretelling**, also called the Reservoir, is an ancient [[Carapa Republic|Carpaean]] ruin deep within [[Drastic]]'s underground water systems. It is a [[Phantasm]], exiting into an isolated divine tower in [[Mount Celestia]].

The Vault once contained 750,000 in ancient [[Gold piece|gold]] pieces, stored with the intentions for the Carapaean Contingency to re-fund the Republic when it fell. Ideally speaking, it could only be open with those with the desire to usurp their invaders in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]]. With this in mind, only the Stone of [[Golorr]] was instructed the necessary steps to open its massive, enchanted door.

Eventually, [[Critical Hit]] solved the mysteries by finding the three key objects, opening the Vault. The Kingdom of Sacred quickly discovered that the Vault had been opened and worked a deal with the heroes to end the [[War of the Masters]].

Just as its sister site, the [[Vault of Foreknowledge]], the Vault of Foretelling was used as a lock for [[Aet'Caldwyn]].

It was eventually blown open by the [[S4]].
