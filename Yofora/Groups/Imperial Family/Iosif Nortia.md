Prince **Iosif Nortia** is [[Serena Nortia|Serena]]'s slightly younger brother, son of his lord-father Prince [[Konstantin Nortia]]. 

Iosif was among the last "gifts" he left the imperial family before he perished. Prince Iosif has been trained in the same spellblade style, though he is more of a tactical commander type than Serena. [[Bianca Nortia]], his mother, was highly protective of him, due to seeing similarities between his father and him.

During the [[Dragonic War]], he was kept distracted by efforts to organize rebellions in [[Umazia]] by the [[Monoceron Exselcis]].

He has the power of [[Monism]].
