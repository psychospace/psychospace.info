**Althin** is a mysterious [[Outsider]] entity, which at least partially represents the instincts of people.

Said to be some kind of "shade" of [[Anti]], itself a [[echo|shade]], Althin controls many planets [[Out There]] and his influence has been felt in many worlds beyond the [[The Heavens|Heavens]]. They are likely the force responsible for certain anomalies of [[Psychospace]], including "moon-entities". [[Imagi]] has subdued them time and time again, as have other spacefaring races and deities.
