The **Fortress**, also called **the Barrow**, is a [[Plane#Realm|planar conduit]] acting as the foundation of [[the Planet]]'s planar substrata, and the source of _[[verlan]]_. It is the primary corridor between the real world and the [[elseworld]], anchored on the [[First City]].

As a low-end derivation of [[Kibangan]], it is a plane of perfecting the concept of perfection. This is where [[Echo|psychic data]] is stored, with the [[Divine Equation]] often literally endlessly written on its [[Axiomite|axiomite]] citizenry and geography. 

# History
## Origins
Supposedly, it has existed since the time of the [[Unknown Era]], making it the oldest planar structure known to the Heavens. Mortals have slipped in and out for eons. 

According to [[Syncretism|syncretic]] literature, when [[The Maker]] and [[The Unmaker]] fused and restructured the world from its remains at the end of the [[War of Chaos]], the Fortress was created, apparently to assure and support the continued idea of a “reality”. 

From within the Fortress, the twins-as-one later known as [[Anti]] bound the flow of [[chaos]] and [[gravity]] which orbited the planet onto this axis point. Anti proceeded to produce two attempts at creating coherent fatal [[Worldline|worldlines]] for the world. The first eventually became [[elseworld]], and the second, and final, became [[the Planet]] as we know it.

##  Prehistory

At some point, probably during [[the Gathering]], the layers of [[Väräh]] and the [[Umbraid]] subducted into the Fortress, their inhabitants permanently isolated and their energies unanchored. Their axial mergers of wood and metal became the fundamental components of the First City.

[[Witchcraft|Witches]] were aware of the plane for centuries, knowing it as **the Barrow**, and carving out [[Not-Where|not-wheres]] from it.

## Modern history
The Fortress was formally reintroduced to the cosmic understanding, during the events leading to the [[Dragonic War]], by [[Octavia Parasom|Octavia]] and [[Amanita Parasom]]. The former had already unknowingly transcended the Fortress as a child, as the shadow-dual of Amanita. 

The files recovered by the [[S4]] at the close of the conflict in [[1251 PT]] unveiled this rediscovery, where it was found that [[Väräh]] was slowly emerging from the space, generating new energy.

After [[Zero Day]], many creatures emerged from the Fortress in response to the [[sky-scrape]], mostly [[Monitor|monitor]] aeons and axiomites. In addition, Väräh and Umbraid began to return piece by piece.

# Properties
It is sometimes considered as a layer even lower than [[the Below]], as though the First City were the core of [[The Planet]], though it can be accessed from anywhere on the planet if [[psychospace]] is stretched thin enough, as was indicated by the *[[Visage of the Fortress]]* ritual.

## Physicality
While the Sheer is compressed compared to the world outside, the Fortress "expands" it, acting as holes into points where the real world is reflected and expanded in all directions. The Fortress's name is also in part due to its expansion of space, manifesting as strange redirections, originated as wedges created by the intersection of [[psychospace]] and [[necrospace]].

While _verlan_ communications only occur on a slight extrapolation of the Fortress, it can expand as far possible as to hide entire physical spaces, such as the case with _[[Not-Where|not-wheres]]_ generated inside it.

# Etymology
It was named during the time of its rediscovery through its relation to the anomalous novel *[[Visage of the Fortress]]*.
