A [[Kobold]] woman who oversees the [[Trinity Seven]] and thus the entire [[Spider's Web]]. She is referred to lovingly (and perhaps fearfully) as the Weaver.

She is golden-scaled, with occasional purple coloring here and there. She is known to be cunning and ruthless, and organized the Trinity Seven as a precaution against assassins.
