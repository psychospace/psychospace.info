>[!quote|subt] [[Termis Tungol]], _Foreword of "An Age Apart"_
>I imagine many of those who grew up fantasizing about [[sorcery]] and swords — thanks to my prose — have either achieved that captured ideal, have reinterpreted it as writers themselves, fostered a love for adventure in their own ways, or... in one particular case, made pacts with entities from the [[Dark Sea]], seeking to harvest any words I left unwritten in that epic. ...And let us be clear, I do not strongly envy one whose very [[soul]] they judge to be worth the eight drafts I threw out. Aim higher, friends.


Esteemed bard and author, one-time leader of the [[Somber Troupe of Arcane Research]] (S.T.A.R.), **Travis "Termis" Tungol**, a [[Drastic|Drasticite]] for most of his life, wrote many a story of [[Critical Hit]]'s adventures. These stories, compiled in the *[[Critical Legends]]* series (in particular [[Gravity & Geneses]]) and accentuated by his sister, Tanya Tungol, and her marketization of [[Endymion (game)|Endymion]] cards, have made their family their fortune, although Travis seems to be constantly running out of money.

Travis lives in a house in [[Lond Point]] called [[Fairmarket Manor]].

Termis Tungol was one of several extant members of the [[Sacred Royal Ultra|Royal Ultra]] who at one time worked for the local press, in this case during the time of Critical Hit's ascension to power. Since this was a time in Drastic where adventurers were largely dissuaded from performing work inside the cities, Termis found himself idolizing the party, agreeing to aid them whenever he could, although this was in exchange for passing on information about their activity to the royal family.
