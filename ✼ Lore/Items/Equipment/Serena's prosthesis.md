A steel-and-brass **prosthetic** replaces [[Serena Nortia|Serena]]'s right leg up to the knee. It was made in early [[1251 PT]], with excellent but hurried craftsmanship [[Shohei Integra|by]] [[Kazumi Integra|the]] [[Maccus Integra|Integras]]. 

It was made necessary when Serena used [[Monism|monism]] to rescue the shattered soul of [[Shohei Integra|Shohei]] during the [[Red Spark|Siege of Drastic]]. Strangely, Serena can still feel her real foot as though the prosthesis isn't even there.

The load-bearing sections of the prosthetic are made of steel for structural integrity while the joints are made with brass for reduced friction. It was made to accommodate her working knee, though it can be locked in place if needed.
