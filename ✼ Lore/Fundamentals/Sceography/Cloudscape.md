A **cloudscape** is any vast volume of [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud) in a [[Skysea|skysea]] in [[The Heavens]]. The [[Wild Blue Yonder]] is bordered above and below by full cloudscapes, which vary in intensity, thickness, visibility, and tumult. 

Clouds are usually created from either the natural [water cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle), or from pieces of [[the Above|the Above]], largely comprised of clouds, drifting to lower planes. Clouds, as forces of elemental [[water]], can facilitate certain life, such as [[fish]].

Clouds are the primary descriptive subject of [[Weather|weather]].
