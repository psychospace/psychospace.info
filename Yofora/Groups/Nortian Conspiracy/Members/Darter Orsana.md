**Darter Orsana** was a [[Beastkin|shifter]] monk (werebear blood) who originally worked under [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] as a jailer. However, at some point he seemed to go completely AWOL, only eventually reappearing in records as part of [[Special Task Force Undergarden]] assumedly as a punishment or reclamation effort.

He uses the Sisyphan Asteroids, twin large dark-gray metal balls connected by a chain from NIMROD's Section 4 R&D, which feel quite weightless in the hand but quite heavy when tossed at you and buried in your skull.
