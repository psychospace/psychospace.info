***Redshift*** was the fifth and final arc of [[⍟ Magical Mystery Tour]], covering the [[S4]]'s mission to Nortia. Taking place predominantly over two extended days of missions, it covered the events of what is known as [[Zero Day]], which would forever change [[the Heavens]].

In *Redshift*, the party embarked towards [[Yofora]] for their final mission to stop the Conspiracy, rescue and cure the ailing [[Lazuli Dino|Linnaeus]], end the war, and return both Nortia and Sacred to proper order. ^df2ba5

Meta-wise, this arc concluded the campaign, with sessions 73 through 81, taking place from September 2023 to February 2024, just barely crossing the four-year anniversary of [[MMT - Arc 1, Nova|Arc 1]]'s beginning.

# Events
### 3-2-1251
Early in the morning, the *[[Wings of Dawn]]* and the *[[Full Velocity]]* arrived at and pierced the [[Dustwall]], and they were swiftly teleported inside to safety at [[Kitofres' Gambit]], in the arms of a now-safe-from-capture [[Maria Simetryevna]]. 

After some hours of planning, the adventurers descended into [[Orkrengrad]], braved its challenges, and held court with [[Uforia]], and in the process of commuting their desires ended up [[⎉ Serena's Uforian message|transmitting a warning]] to all of Nortian blood. 

Following this, the party rapidly made their way to the [[Nail of Nortia]], where Linnaeus is being held, and where the building is going through a severe and dangerous overcharge. However, they are snagged by a looping staircase and temporarily brought to [[Farborough Manor]], where they learn some of the origins of the Conspiracy, and solve the mystery found inside *[[Visage of the Fortress]]* to proceed through [[the Fortress]] and back to the Nail.

![[Amanita Parasom#^791d05]]
[[Amanita Parasom]] and their distraught memories aside, the final battle with [[Arahabaki]] loomed, and the party bravely entered Linnaeus's personal psychospace, transformed into a burning forest and chaotically destroyed church. 

![[Catclaw#^ff8b48]] ![[Catclaw#^7e1c5d]]
Despite a near-loss of Star of the North to the rapidly devolving immortal dragon, the growing power held within [[Catclaw]], and the work of all of the members of the S4, had paid off, and Linnaeus was safe from the dragonic curse at last. Arahabaki was shattered, and the sword which bore its mind was no more: save for one piece, which had suddenly gone missing at the most inopportune moment.

Shortly afterward, Iosif's armada arrived inside New Orc airspace, offering protection from an apparent invasion force of auto-soldiers which threatened the sanctity of their mission. Aboard the mighty Sekkan-shin, Amanita was delivered back to Farborough, in anticipation of some kind of prison sentence, while Linnaeus and his rescuers were taken back to the Gambit. 

There, the prince, still struggling to process the months he'd spent outside himself, unfortunately confirmed Amanita's suspicions that the empress had been possessed for some time by the mistress of Illarion Parasom: [[Scarla Nitrum]].

### 3-3-1251

After a well-deserved rest, Ikabod, Eldral, Star, Linnie, and Sekkan were teleported back to the *Wings of Dawn*, safely protected through the night by Arthur's spells. Iosif gave Serena a brief update on the situation before the party returned, one last time, to the Nail of Nortia, to put this grim destiny to rest at last. There, they found the disgraced [[Illarion Parasom]], near-death for his inability to stop the prince's retrieval, and in grave despair at his foolishness for attempting to stop the inevitable. After granting the once-Lord with last rites, he was turned to dust, and the party's attention turned to their final enemy. 

Inside Bianca's body, the malevolent force known as [[Scarla Nitrum|Nemain]] was no longer one for subtlety, insistent that its "negotiation" not be interrupted, and that it would use the power of the tower they were gathered on in order to tell her allies that this world was to be considered "valuable". She was ignorant of the ultimate fate of the people, just as Illarion had warned them of: and especially not of the body that she had stolen.

The final battle was long and difficult, but the space-goddess was not immortal under this star, and its lack of humanity was ultimately its undoing, freeing Bianca from its body before assuming its rough, mighty, but mortal ultimate form. Nemain was put to death by [[Serratura Neeman|Serratura]]'s [[Catclaw]] and Serena's [[psychobullet]], a last-minute gift by Maria. 

Immediately afterward, the machine etching the [[rune]] onto the sky itself began to tear apart, and the S4 had to step in to shoulder the skies, ensuring the rune did not cause a colossal [[The Sheer#Wildcat destabilization|wildcat destabilization]] and effectively bring about a [[TPK]]. Despite her injuries, Serena knew that her destiny was here, and realized her magic was more potent than ever, as [[Uforia]] herself prayed for their success. 

As their task neared its grueling end, time seemed to slow, and a [[tailed stranger]] arrived. Though it attempted to kill the S4 and "save the world", at the whims of some unknown group, it could only put a bullet in the ground, and instead confided in the S4 that it realized it should keep its efforts a secret, admiring the beauty of the frozen scene, the "eye in a storm", and that "the end is not the end".

The flow of time resumed, and the sky-scrape, which had burned purple and deadly, grew dull and drained. The world was safe from destruction, and the Nortian Empire was back in its true hands, at long, long last. 

The S4's long mission was over.
