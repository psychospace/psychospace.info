![[âŽŠ Hazel's Arrival#^860f97]]

**Ildy** was the old [[Eidolon]] defender of [[Drastic]] who embodied love. In essence, as eidolon of the capitol, he was chief amongst all other eidolons in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]].

[[Lazuli Dino|Linnie]]'s traveling companion, the ever-faithful eidolon was one of the sole confidants of the young prince's [[Dragonic Curse|curse]].

However, he was [[Red Spark|killed]] viciously by the [[Nortian Conspiracy]], and he dropped the [[Wand of Mythos]] upon death.
