**Firearms** are weapons which propel projectiles using explosive force. They were supposedly first reverse-engineered from hypothetical works crafted by [[Nunes Daedal]], a progenitor to [[Viers Callinan]]. 

# Mounted firearms


Invested in chemistry and metallurgy due to its twin remnants, and perhaps for other reasons too, the [[Great Nortian Empire|Great Empire of Nortia]] was the first to invent the **cannon**, which quickly propagated for its ability to improve the speed of conquest. No longer would magicians need to train many years to be able to operate on a ship: now any common man could blast apart their foes with ease. ^b7417d

As with many developments in weaponry, this triggered an arms race over the past two centuries, leading to many advancements in mechanical understanding, including the fusion of magic and technology in the form of modern alchemy (including lux infrastructure, which further enhanced magical research). This also, on the more dour side of things, led to the events of the [[War of the Masters]], as technologically superior nations exerted colonial invasion on those weaker in the [[Colossal Ocean]].

# Handheld firearms
Handheld firearms are still not yet in great numbers as of [[1250 PT]], although they have been rising in popularity to match the creation of a mysterious superweapon known as the [[Psychobullet]]. This legendary piece of ammunition, usually crafted for cannons, would be far more effective as an assassination tool and far more efficient to produce if it could be fired by one person instead of with a crew of twelve onboard an airship. Similarly, enchanting a firearm is an equally complex process, so they are in even fewer numbers.

The most well known handheld firearm in current year is the **morgan crossbow**, which is a scoped crossbow capable of firing red-hot bolts far into the horizon line crafted by famed [[Pinwheel]] engineer **Morgana Laufie.** It is essentially a crossbow with explosive pieces. The most elite of the [[City & Castle]] Guards in the [[Kingdom of Sacred]] are equipped with a new form of firearm aptly called a **handdragon**, a sidearm they use in their off-hand, capable of firing round shot with such a spin that even hitting armor or shields won't stop it from skidding off and carving more damage into its targets.

## Rifle-axes
Rifle-axes were early developments in the post-war period of Nortia, and its creation represented the pinnacle of their early exploration of the modern spellblade style. [[Homecoming]] is a premier example. 

The axe-head is intended to be used while sieging forts or taking on heavy beasts, while at range its heft assists in stabilizing the barrel. It can also hold an electrical charge, able to channel through and fry somebody wearing armor from within.
