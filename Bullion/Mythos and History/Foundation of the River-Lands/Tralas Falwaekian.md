Lady **Tralas Falwaekian**, sometimes called the second Witch of the Cosmos, was the [[Siella Valley|Siellan]] [[harengon]] founder of the [[Coven of the Night]]. A first-order apprentice [[Witchcraft|witch]] of [[Maedil Rysae]], Falwaekian was broadly influential as the prophetess who spoke of Maedil's deeds and spread her teachings in the lands beyond the [[River-Lands of Ancestral Ith'Paraan|River-Lands]].

It was Lady Tralas, trained by hand and given the [[Gift of Stars]], who discovered its powers had become docile and useful again, after the reckless horrors wrought by it during the [[Bullion#Miserable Age|Miserable Age]].

For her influence as a famous witch, Tralas became the namesake of [[Tralas|an islet]] in the [[Wabi Steppe]].
