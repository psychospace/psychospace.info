A **ghost storm**, also known as the **purple storm** or a **[[portal]] storm**, is an aberration in [[Logic]] which exists as a tangible semi-permanent hole in [[Psychospace]]. 

The storm, not unlike the sphere of annihilation, exacts tolls on [[Logic|Logic]]. As such anyone who uses psychospace to traverse long distances across the storm's radius has a high chance of injury while the storm lingers.

In [[The Heavens]], it manifests as a [[Weather]] pattern of a violaceous storm which effects lower or zero [[Gravity]]. If someone or something is brought into the storm, they vanish into an unknown space, and may never return. As was witnessed by [[Serratura Neeman]], the realm predicted several events, and was guarded by [[Phantasma Goria]].
