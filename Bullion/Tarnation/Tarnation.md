The [[Flipside]] of the [[Remnant]] of [[Bullion]], called **Tarnation**, **Jackland**, or **Blackjack**, and known outside of [[Shindani]] as **Gehena**, is an alien plane full of animosity and lawlessness. All attempts to settle it have failed due to its equally alien native species. Exile to Jackland is seen as a death sentence.

# History

Originally, Jackland began to form as a result of the outcome of [[The Gathering]], with the [[Divinity|gods]] and the [[Outsider|Outsiders]] having formed the pact that led to the [[The Heavens]] and the [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]]. Powerful [[Elemental creatures|elementals]], cut off from their kin and full of rage at being denied [[Mortal God Ritual|godhood]], some [[Genie|genies]] attempted to create their own pecking order for life, with themselves at the top. Their influence on the environment (now limited and inflamed by the gods) resulted in innumerable miniscule [[Altercation|altercations]] which collectively led to the state of Jackland.

# Etymology
"Jackland" is an antiquated [[Archipel|Archipelian]] term which referred to unused or unsettled land due to infertility or plain superstition: specifically land that was not pressed territorially, those alloted to humans or ceded to [[Fiend|fiends]] ("jacks") or the elements, as in the use-case "Jack can have it". Following much of the event of the [[Ith'Paraan#Miserable Age|Miserable Age]], "Jackland" came to define many places on both sides of Bullion. 

Eventually, the term came to alone refer to the flipside, and its usage as an idiom outside of that was replaced by the phrase "*tierra de nadie*" - no man's land.
