The **Dino Airstyle** (DAS, or Airstyles) are the trained guardians of the sky over [[Drastic]] and some other regions. At one point, this exclusively included [[griffon]] riders, but now employs other flight-capable races or some aided by technology. They are often a source of recruitment for the [[Sacred Dragoon Force]]. They are overseen by [[Cefal]] and are based in [[Union Keep]].
