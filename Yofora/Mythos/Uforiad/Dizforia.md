**Dizforia** is a mental shard of [[Uforia]] which portends destruction. Generalized, it is Uforia’s [yetzer hara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yetzer_hara), a manifest impulse to misuse its gods-given abilities. As a member of the [[Temple of the Uforiad|Uforiad]], it is called “Dream of Defilement”.

It came into a realized existence in its youth when it received a grim portent. This trickster instinct was prophesied to lead to the destruction of [[Arahabaki|thirteen people]]’s will to live, and the death of their whole tribes. To defy this premonition, Uforia was said to have excised a fragment of her very [[Echo|shadow]], returning it to [[Kibangan]].

In some interpretations, Dizforia is an alternate form of Uforia from another universe: in others, it is a sibling or familial relation. It is most accurately, as scholars would tell you, akin to a second personality within the psionic field of the dragon, one which is knowingly repressed and stripped of power.  

It is the existence of Dizforia within her mind that is often why Uforia is called specifically a demon-dragon hybrid.

The story of its prophetic existence has led to a national cabalistic fascination or aversion to the number 13, believed to represent bad or deviant luck (a belief that has spread to other cultures and other remnants).
