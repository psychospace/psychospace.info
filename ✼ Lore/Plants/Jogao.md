*<span class="explain" title="[joh-GOW-ZAY-ah] or [yo-GOW-ZAY-ah] depending on dialect">**Jogaozea**</span>*, known commonly as ***<span class="explain" title="[joe-GOW], or [yo-GOW] depending on dialect">jogao</span>*** or **jog-plants**, is a tall, bluish-green grass that produces a [cereal grain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal)[^1]. The top of the plant produces vibrant bundles of hardy, sweet seeds, each kernel producing its own unique sugars that are edible on their own: these kernels can also be used to prepare many different dishes, such as flours, spreads, and juices.

*Jogao* does not [naturally spread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultigen), but has been able to grow in many varied environments. Cultivation over time has produced incredibly resilient crops.

Throughout [[Bullion]], *jogao* is a culturally significant plant, and is identified as a product of [[Bioh]]'s influence on the remnant. Its have been a traditional staple reflecting the return of life to the remnant[^2], first domesticated by [[Siella Valley|Siellan]] societies. 

# Etymology
*Jogao* means "fruit of return" in [[MÃ¤nyya]] (particularly in the [[Arnecca]] dialect), owing to its cultural origin as some of the first recoverable crops on Bullion[^2]. *Jogaozea* can be translated as "flower of return".

It is commonly known in in [[Shindani]] as **rain grass**, due to the plant's tendency to grow more blue on its stem than its leaves, occasionally making the stalks appear like a fallen trail of [[weather|rain]].
