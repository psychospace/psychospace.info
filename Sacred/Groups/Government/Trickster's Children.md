A sector of the royal guard of the [[Kingdom of Sacred]], the **Trickster's Children** is a temple of [[Melotte]]. It trains and rehabilitates juvenile criminals by wielding and channeling their innate rebellious nature through powerful masks, creating a veritable army of trickster clerics for use in reconnaissance, investigation, and counter-espionage. The concept was originally posited to the Judges of [[Drastic]] by [[Nery Ravenna|Gearhunter Nery]], who was taught in similar fashion by his master.

All children put through this rehabilitative program undergo rigorous psychological re-tuning, reshaping them to fit the "model children" they are taught to revere as if they were gods. These groups of model children each form a sort of "divine constellation", all appended to scripture to facilitate "learning from the mistakes of others".

They are overseen by King [[Tyranno Re Ursus]] [[House Dino|Dino]] and Master [[Ijouti Cilin]].

[[ELIZ]] is a member.
