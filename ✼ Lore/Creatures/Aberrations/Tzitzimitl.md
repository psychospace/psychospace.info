A **tzitzimitl** (plural: **tzitzimimeh**) was a monstrous ancient [[Divinity|god]]-like [[aberration]] whose influence was manifest [[Out There|from the stars]]. Emissaries of an unknown world, the tzitzimimeh are intended to be silent spectators to the development of [[manifold seas]].

The only tzitzimitl seen in modern times on [[the Planet]] was [[Scarla Nitrum|Nemain]], who had [[Nortian Conspiracy|usurped]] [[Great Nortian Empire|Nortia]] in order to enact her own plans.^[The information in this article was primarily sourced from the investigation of the Nortian government following [[Zero Day]]; Scarla kept journals intended for potential new [[reincarnation|iterations]] of herself.]

# Appearance
Through the perceived form of [[Scarla Nitrum]], it is now known that tzitzimimeh possess a mostly skeletal humanoid appearance, possessing an eclipse-like halo which marks their face and their "exemption" from the [[star]] that governs them, and lengthy, electrified limbs, each of which end in hand-like forms. 

Though they prefer to act formlessly as possessive spirits, out of sight and undetected, they are prone to twist and maim their prey such that they resemble their own shape, for an unknown reason. This appearance (as well as their tendency to forgo their own [[body]]) led to their association with [[undead]], though they do not possess an inherent power over that domain.

They also were capable of projecting a massively powerful [[Magic#Intent|aura]], a result of their usually formless appearance.

However, when incredibly threatened, spared the need for subtlety, a tzitzimitl might assume its true form, a great roiling mass of alien-god flesh.

# Role
Their goals, as spectators, appeared to be to guide new worlds to foster powers which [[Chartless Sea|chartless]] beings could use to influence the [[Manifold Seas|manifold]] universe. Nemain provided as one example the ability to alter the ultimate fate of atoms which formed a [[star]], altering the destiny of the entire sea. 

According to Nemain, this necessitates, in most cases, the planting of certain seeds and elements which leads to civilizations. 

By creating these powers, the tzitzimimeh may bargain with other [[Outsider|Outsiders]] that a world is valuable to a cause and not to be obliterated, subject to the incomprehensible hierarchy of the Outsiders.

# Abilities

These deities, beyond expected godhood, were capable of subverting them, and so have on occasion used their influence to create massive ripple effects, using this mortal plane as a testing ground for other weaponry. Tzitzimimeh were intended to guide the fate of manifold seas. Among the influences of the tzitzimimeh were the forced evolution and creation of the [[aboleth]].

Their meddling in the birth of [[Arizhmiya|Lagacia]] resulted in the eventual arising, one million years later, of the power called [[occultation]].

However, the tzitzimimeh are ultimately fallible to the status of the manifold sea, which they are forced to conform themselves to in the course of their duty. They do not possess as much influence as their Outsider origins, especially on this world following a likely [[Calamity of the Eyes]].

If a tzitzimitl were to perish, though its godlike power, it was not [[immortal]], and it is unlikely that it would experience anything of an afterlife. From Nemain's notes, it appeared that something alike to [[reincarnation]] was typical, however the process of being killed would interrupt it, incentivizing her carefulness. However, ultimately truly knows what occurs.

# History
After being introduced to [[the planet]] during the [[Unknown Era]], they became ambassadors of sorts to [[Welkin]], first meeting [[Anti]] and reminding the entity that it was not alone. Should the gods ever wish to contact Outside influence, they would do so through the tzitzimimeh. The obvious "conflict of interest" between the gods and the masters of the tzitzimimeh led to the characteristic disdain the gods felt for Outsiders.

There were three tzitzimimeh assigned to [[the Planet]], [[Soul bond|spiritually connected]] to one another. These three were known to various cultures as [[Scarla Nitrum|Nemain]], [[Macha]], and Badb: these names (as well as the term "tzitzimitl" itself) are first attested in the [[Apocrypha of Winds]], possibly sourced from the personal interpretations of [[Old world|old worlders]].

Of these, only Nemain remained mortal into the modern age, while Macha acquiesced to the role of [[Avatar of Death]], and Badb vanished into obscurity.
