**[Copper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper)** is a brownish reflective metal of moderate value, associated with nature. It was largely used in the [[Age of Primordia]] in the earliest tools and armor, seen as "their metal" compared to their [[immortal]] masters' gold, silver, and [[electrum piece|electrum]] items. 

Unlike [[Silver piece|silver]], [[Gold piece|gold]], and [[platinum piece|platinum]], for most of history, copper had very little direct [[magic]] utility or value. The earliest translation of the [[Apocrypha of Winds]] details copper as capable of transmitting electrical power and necessary for the databanks it was recovered from, but makes little mention of much in the way of practical uses for it.

The metal was largely supplanted and upended in use by bronze for most purposes, and although copper was easy to work, it was often outdone in physical properties. Copper [[Dragon|dragons]] are known as "jokesters", not just because of their outlook on life and treatment of the world around them, but also because of the perceived "unseriousness" of their scale's metallic nature. [[Copper piece|Copper pieces]] are coins made with copper.

Copper is considered beautiful by many cultures, but its tendency to corrode has led to many artifacts of copper being lost to time.
