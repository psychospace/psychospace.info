**Humans** are a hardy, diverse, #sapient species who have spread throughout [[The Heavens]]. Individual humans may live about a century, and most have generational breaks every quarter-century. A group of humans does not have a well-adopted turn of phrase.

# Properties
In place of the abilities and tendencies many other ancestries possess, these peoples make up for that with their impeccable adaptability and creativity, often taking political or philosophical roles. Humans can self-heal to certain degrees and recover from grievous wounds on a much shorter timescale. In conjunction with their adaptability, this is perhaps accounting for their limited lifespans.

Though often viewed in the contexts of individual cultures, humans come in many shapes and sizes, each unique in their own way. Humans are usually assigned a gender at birth, in accordance with their sex, and intersex humans (allowed to live that way) are born in the small but vocal minority. 

Some may buck tradition and seek their own gender identity, while many typical communities are against the idea (as of [[1285 PT]]), depending on their point of origin and the surrounding peoples.

# History
It is a widely held folklore belief that at least humans and [[Elf|elves]] were once one and the same, both aspects of the [[First Magicians]]. When these people mastered [[Magic]], and used it to undertake an [[immortal]] being's form, of mutable strength and form, they became the first elves. 

The remainders instead took their mortality for granted, saw how it changed the connections one had to the divinity, and used their gift of magic to instead evoke material advancement, study, and love. After [[The Gathering]], this splinter heritage became humanity.

Mankind since has been found throughout every remnant, springing up like weeds. Their reach is so diverse and vast that *humanoid* as a term has been adopted to describe any four-limbed species which stands upright. It is often difficult to assert *how* a human will live their seemingly short life, but they control many kingdoms.
