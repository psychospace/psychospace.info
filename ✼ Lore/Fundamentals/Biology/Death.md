**Death**, much like the real-world process, is a process of entropy which afflicts all mortal beings. It occurs when a [[Soul|soul]] departs its [[Body|body]]: in other words, when a [[Creature|creature]]'s lifespan comes to an end. In [[Magic|magic]], the [[Domain|domain]] of death and domain of the grave are energies associated with [[Light (property)#Darkness|Darkness]].
# Occurrence
When death occurs, the memories of the soul are released by the body (as [[Echo|echoes]]) as the soul sheds all living regrets and pains to embark on the journey to the [[Scarlet Skies]]. Following death, a creature will usually eventually [[Reincarnation|reincarnate]], though this might not be into the same form as its previous life.

[[Immortal|Immortals]] are immune to the permanence of death, while most creatures, mortals, are beholden to it and respect the concept in a variety of ways. The negation of a death is a magic skill known as [[Resurrection]]. The process of a persistent ignorance of death is known as [[Necromancy]]. Many sapient races possess (or used to possess) a psionic rite known as [[Succession (ability)|Succession]], which offsets the death of a soul by sending it on to another being for various uses.
# Afterlife
The journeys souls take to the Scarlet Skies are supervised by [[Psychopomp|psychopomps]], as well as their *[[Fylgja|fylgja]]*. When a soul reaches [[Unwri]], it is usually delievered its final sentence by [[Exponen|Nexos]] and the current [[Avatar of Death]], which cycles with the era. A soul then fuses with their *fylgja* into a [[Petitioner]].

As is known of [[Ith'Paraan|Ith'Par]] texts, a creature of [[The Heavens]] who perishes outside the influence of the [[Welkin]] is unable to return to [[The Planet]], and thus their afterlife, if any, is unknown.
