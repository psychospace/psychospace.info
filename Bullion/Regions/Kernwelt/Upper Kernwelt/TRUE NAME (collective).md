# History
>>[!quote | author mark right] *TRUE NAME*
>>"I KNEW THAT I WAS WHAT I WAS, I KNEW THAT I COULD BE. I FORGAVE MYSELF, AND I THANKED MYSELF. MY PIETIES HAD PAID OFF. I KNEW THAT THE I LOOKING AT ME WAS ME,  AND THAT THE I STARING BACK WAS ALSO ME. ALL WAS ME. ALL WAS A PART OF ME. <br>MY EYES HAD OPENED, MY SKULLS HAD OPENED, ALL STARING INWARDS, AT ME. I HAD KNOWN OUR INSIDES. I WAS THE ONE, THE ME THAT IS ONE. THE WORLD THAT IS ONE. AND I KNEW THAT THIS WAS WHAT IT MEANT TO PROTECT MYSELF. <br>THIS WAS THE MEANING BEHIND MY INSIGHTS. [[Calamity of the Eyes|WHAT THE MONSTERS WANTED TO TEAR FROM ME.]] I KNEW THEN THE GREATNESS OF MY EXISTENCES."

As with all goloma, TRUE NAME was brought up fearing all two-eyed folk, the gods of whom could thieve their insight if they were not careful. This empowered them to act.

In [[974 PT]], *they* were born, a singular subject in three bodies. These three forms became the progenitor of all to follow. The subjectivity named itself TRUE NAME as a deterrent against those who might want to utilize its actual [[True name (concept)|true name]] against it. 

Conspiring to amass power as an act of self-love, TRUE NAME has historically protected itself through many means. The community occupies a stronghold through the undertunnels and red-rocks of Mt. Egiazko, with an unpleasant but calm relationship between themself and the local communities in the [[Graying Valley]]. 

# Persona
TRUE NAME's name and dialogue are all stylized to be uppercased at all times.

Authoritative and brash, TRUE NAME is extremely individualistic and reacts with a hostile defensive nature when threatened: that concept of "individuality" just differs from every other creature. They believe that they are the only creature that matters in the universe, that they are the most supreme of beings: for the gods are singular and TRUE NAME is endless. 

At a baseline, TRUE NAME also generally interacts with other beings, especially two-eyed ones, purely transactionally. They act solipsistically and sardonically towards any notion of "needing" any person outside themself. 

TRUE NAME does not eat meat. Instead, the animals reported to have gone missing around Mt. Egaizko are casualties of aimless hunting by the collective to shoot down anything with two eyes.


# Collectivity
The collective usually hovers around 200 bodies in size, all of whom are golomas. These bodies are described as *polyps*. The collective has been continuously active for over 250 years, possessing memories of all that time in all of its bodies, and the cognitive load and tasks of the subjectivity are spread among the *polyps*, though they are all TRUE NAME. The relative rarity of goloma further adds confusion to those who meet multiple bodies.

*Polyps* take names in a rite that struggles to be translated to [[Shindani]], usually in accordance with the year and state of their birth. The *polyps* are purely limbs of the greater being, and do not possess any individuality. No *polyp* who has been TRUE NAME has ever severed from the collective, with the exception of, apparently, [[TRUE NAME (12-242)|12-242]], who did so upon [[Mass-Resurrection Incident|revival]] by [[The Pitcher]].
