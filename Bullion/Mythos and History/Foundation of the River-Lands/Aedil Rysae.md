**Aedil Rysae**, [[Witchcraft|Witch]] of the Skies, is a mythological figure of [[Bullion]]. He was brother of [[Maedil Rysae]], consort of [[Ithuriel Rysae|Ithuriel]]. Aedil and Maedil both served Ithuriel with their prowess, with the latter exercising control over [[logic]] through the motion of [[star|stars]], while the former exercised control over [[chaos]] through the motion of the [[Skysea|skies]].

Today his contributions have rendered him something of a [[saint]]. He is the namesake of the [[Aedil Plains]], one half of the [[Aed & Maed]].

Unlike Maedil, Aedil's exact [[Gift (witchcraft)|Gift]] is lost to history, though by some [[Syncretism|syncretists]] he is believed to have been an adherent of [[Saint]] [[Alvan]], whose manifestation as a storm suggests a mastery over the skies.
