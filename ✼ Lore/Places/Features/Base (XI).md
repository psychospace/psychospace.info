>[!quote|author] First Baseman
>This place is a story that used to belong to [[The Pitcher|them]]. But it's mine now. Take it from me, if you dare.

The **Bases** are a strange locational [[Psinomenon|psinomenon]] created by the influence of [[The Pitcher]], emerging during the events following the [[Mass-Resurrection Incident]] in [[1249 PT]]. They were the subject of investigation during the events of *[[‚çü Extra Innings]]*.

# Properties
The true purpose of the Bases is currently unknown. The Bases, according to the First Baseman, are *literally* fragments of the story of the Pitcher, which are being taken control of to keep that story from them.

These Bases were anchored on [[Psychospace|psychospacial]] anomalies, primarily creating [[Confluence|confluxes]] of [[Void energy|negative]] and [[Vitality energy|positive energy]]. These produced strange phenomena in the regions they were apparently bound to, including spatial distortion, [[Time]] dilation, and manifestations of despair.

## Stitched

When the Bases produced [[Undead|undead plagues]], their victims would be reconstructed with a strange energy that gave them the appearance of having been knit back together. The name which emerged for these beings was the "Stitched".

Stitched also apparently attacked the victims of the Mass-Resurrection when they traveled between the Bases. It appears as though the plagues themselves were some form of defense mechanism.

## Baseman

Each Base also has a **Baseman**, an entity which maintained it, and would cause the Base's anomaly to vanish if destroyed. The entity seems to be related to the history of the Base itself, as the first Baseman was a Stitched form of a patriarchal figure.

# Locations
According to the rules of [[skitball]], there must be apparently three "bases"^[or four, if home plate is counted]. The bases' locations have some kind of relation to [[Ciro Enfys]]'s history.

Two bases are discovered at present: the first at [[Estelis Ranch]], and the second in a "[[Lavas Hideaway|hideaway]]" in [[Raldena]].
