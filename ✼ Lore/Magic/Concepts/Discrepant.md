In [[Magic]], "**discrepant**" is a descriptor for effects and entities whose [[Epitome]] is without linear cause-and-effect: in other words, subjects or victims of 'time-travel'. As a rule, so long as they challenge [[Logic]], discrepants are not allowed to remain in their state for long, due to the resolution effects of the [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]].

In the case of false [[Antique|antiques]], discrepancies are resolved primarily by the fact that this time-travel is self-fulfilling. These objects are made older "in-place", as such objects rarely have perspective prior to their willpower as tsukumogami.

The most well-known example is the [[Amakudari's phantom|phantom]] of [[Amakudari-no-Mikoto|Amakudari]] which appeared before its younger self. Because of the overlapping existences, the rogue instance of Amakudari, whose life was about to end, is known as a "discrepant phantom".
