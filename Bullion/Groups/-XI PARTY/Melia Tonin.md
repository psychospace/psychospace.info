Dr. **Melia "Mellie" Tonin** is an acclaimed [[Owohain|Owoi]] [[Kitsune|kitsune]] alchemist and healer.

# History

Melia was born near to the end of [[1217 PT]] to [[Cera Tonin]].

Melia trained in chirurgery at the [[Third Institute]]. 

In [[1248 PT]], she planned to attend the Conference on Agricultural Alchemy and Cultivation Magicks held in [[Eleyda]]. However, she was reported as missing and presumed dead after the airship she was traveling on, the *[[Alexander (airship)|Alexander]]*, crashed near [[Anacoreta]]. The official investigation determined that the crash occurred due to an engine failure that was a deliberate work of sabotage.

She was later, mysteriously, [[Mass-Resurrection Incident|revived]] by a [[The Pitcher|pallid stranger]], and eventually pursued the bounty put out by the [[Daily Grind]].
