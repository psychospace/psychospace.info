An **airship feather** is a white feather plucked from the wings of an [[Airship]]'s [[Core engine]] with a special [[Dawndust]] apparatus, allowing it to maintain some of its magical capabilities. Holding onto it slows a person's descent by a significant margin. 

Just like most airships, this feather cannot survive the heat of the [[Scarlet Skies]] and doesn't allow its user to survive that descent.
