An occult circle of like-minded troublemakers and artificers, centered on [[Broadcaster|Broadcasters]] of various talent, jokingly self-identified as the ***Single-Brain Cell***, or “*One-Brace*” for short, referred to as "*the project*", has emerged as a group of note in [[Bullion]] in the last four years (as of [[1285 PT]]). They are widely viewed as a coordinated group of [eco-terrorists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-terrorism).

Known to be bonded telepathically and through several items, the SBC was originally believed to be part of alchemical trafficking, but is now known for creating many dead-ends in the [[The Shibboleth|Shibb]]-wide hunt for the [[Lynchpin Device|lynchpin devices]], through complex pranks, [[Reality-Bending|reality-twitching]] enchantments, [[Antique#False antiques|false antiques]], and catastrophic schemes.

One-Brace seem to be a group of powerful, if mentally dubious, but otherwise normal teenagers and young-adults from throughout [[Bullion]]. Based on the variety of actions they've taken responsibility for, their actions are persistently in protest for the Shibboleth's actions regarding [[new magic]].

Some of the actions they have been blamed for include firebombing the [[Sinag National Library]], embarrassing [[Ithibela Rysae|Suimari]] on her 112th birthday, disrupting [[Third Institute]] professors with an enchantment forcing them to sing their lectures, and other audacious acts of vandalism and crime. 

According to [[Numberless Children|Nulk]] literature, the SBC's methods and actions speak to a desire to protect the lynchpins, and other talented [[Psion|psions]] like themselves, from those who seek to abuse and confine them, as well as a sense of camaraderie and fun using their gifts collaboratively. 

There is no greater ambition for them other than to live free, to join friends in painting goofy stick figures on a multiversal canvas.

# Views
The SBC are not known for murder or directly-hostile activity outside of protest, but are definitive enemies with multiple factions for their actions, including deliberately disrupting [[Blue Cinder Militia|militia]] investigations.

They are mortal enemies of the [[Fifth Institute]]. Due to being comprised of Broadcasters, they almost effortlessly evade authority with their [[Codec|powers]], but do appear to have remorse and will appear for questioning when the occasion is right. They will not take a life if they can manage, which isn’t something their clients (or their mistakes, for that matter) can say the same.

# Membership
They were founded by the pseudonymous quintet of *[[Clover]], [[Marrow-in-Reeds]], [[The Best]], [[Hierophant]],* and *[[Rise-and-Shine]].* They were supposedly assembled by [[R. S. Langford]], and are known to be led by the entity's adoptive daughter. 

Authorities believe there to be 26 or so individuals in the SBC, most of which are peripheral non-Broadcasting aides or magic creations. There also appears to be a network of connections that support them, much to the displeasure of the groups investigating them.

Despite fandom and romanticization in the news, there is apparently no reliable means of contacting SBC.
