**The Above** is the [[Shindani]] term given to the realm of storm and [[Dragon|dragons]], which exists as a layer of the planet over top the [[Wild Blue Yonder]] and beneath the [[Dark Sea]]. In [[The Heavens]], it is the highest and largest plane which can support mortal life, though most from the Wild Blue would be suffocated by the pressure.

Some creatures which dwell in the Above include [[leviathan|leviathans]].

Existing at the fringes of [[The Planet]]'s atmosphere, the Above is best described as a tumultuous and contemplative plane.
