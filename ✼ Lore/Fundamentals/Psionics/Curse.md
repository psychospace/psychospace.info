A **curse** is any affliction sourced from extremely potent [[magic]], superstition, or animosity, which results in distortions to the body, the mind, and the [[Time|future]]. 

Each curse is a long-standing, semi-permanent influence that anchors themselves deep into the [[Logic|Logic]] of the [[The Heavens|Heavens]]. Nearly anyone can lay a curse, summoning power buried deep inside the [[Light (property)|Darkness]] of the [[soul]]: you don't even need to cast a [[spell]] to do it.

# Properties
## Creation
Powerful [[Echo|memories and emotions]] (focused and ensorcelled) are often the [[Tribute|cost]] and source of curses, since one needs to almost permanently burn their own influence on [[psychospace|psychospace]].

A magical curse usually is directed at a particular individual, lineage, location, or something more vague (such as a faction fitting a specific description^[As in the dragonic curse, which followed the [[Sacred Line of Succession|line of succession]] for [[Kingdom of Sacred|Sacred]].]). The more specific a curse's target, and the stronger the power, the more powerful the final curse's effects can be. 

Passively, though rarely, curses can manifest with the effects of things like [[Confluence|confluences]] and [[Psinomenon|psinomena]]. For example, if someone is promised something, and that promise is reneged on, a curse may take root between the offended parties. In wartime, it is a sound tactical consideration to delay attacking a belligerent target in order to avoid invoking a curse out of the suffering you cause.

## Effects

A curse's effects can take almost any form, as can animosity itself, trumping things like [[Arcane complexity|arcane complexity]], if the caster is willing to pay the costs. Curses, like [[Wish|wishes]], are usually phrased in plain language^[Such as, *'I curse you so that no man shall love you, ever again.'*] to make their effect more clear and more likely to harm the target as intended.

In the case of a more opportunistic curse, to make the effect more potent, the caster usually offers some difficult task as a freedom condition, a form of additional tribute.^[One example of this kind of curse is the mythologically-significant curse of *'I curse you to turn into a [[frog]], a form which will become permanent for you unless you find true love's kiss in the next 3 [[Starfall|starfalls]].'*]

### Personhood of a curse
Sometimes, a curse can manifest as a presence in the mind, or as a broken memory. When this occurs, it provides one inner access to aspects of themselves, though it might also provide a powerful point for the curser to ingratiate with their target, taking over their mind or viewing through their eyes.

For some examples:
* The [[House of Horrors]] used the bonds they created to keep an eye on extant bounties.
* When [[Volk Vendleberg|Volk]] was bitten and afflicted with [[Primal curse|lycanthropy]], he was able to meditate and put himself face to face with his [[Fylgja]].
* When the [[dragonic curse]] struck, [[Arahabaki]] manifested through the [[Dragonic whillo|whillos]] it created.
## Curing a curse
Curses, in general, have no cure, due to how potent they are. When treating a curse, each individual should be taken as a wholly unique case.

To excise a curse, curses and their influence can't be simply destroyed. They must be "[[Remove curse|removed]]" such as through a transfer to a surrogate, with the energy of the invoked curse remaining in the world but in a harmless (or at least, *less harmful*) form. 

Most clerics worth their salt are aware of this, and use idols or effigies to burn away the influence of curses. Sometimes, these kinds of curses can form [[Antique|artifacts]] borne of this lingering [[Magic#intent|intent]]. 

If one does not provide a curse a home, the potent magic can change forms, becoming a [[figment]] devoid of original [[context]], or cause psychospacial [[off-wave|pollution]]. 

### Revoking a curse

Whenever a curse is laid, the cursing individual causes damage to their own soul, as the effects forge a [[Soul bond|link]] between the target and the curser. This usually requires the person laying the curse to maintain the curse, often on a regular basis.

If the curser wants to revoke a curse they've laid, they need only sever that link: but a task like that is more difficult and abstract, often coming down to renouncing much of what led them to make the curse in the first place.

# Well-known curses
While not all curses have names, most curses have mythological associations with them: for example, [[Undead|undeath]] is widely considered a curse, as it permanently stains the soul (until [[Reincarnation|rebirth]]).

## Curse words

Sometimes when people speak of "cursing", they are speaking of **curse words**, sometimes called **cusses**. These are words which invoke incredibly minor sacrilege to the [[Divinity]] whenever they are spoken. 

Comparisons to [[Golden Voice|power words]] are not without some merit, as even [[Immortal|immortals]] balk at anyone who speaks a curse word in their presence. Why is unclear, but it is likely that moral standards (such as those reinforced by [[Dawndust]]'s prevalence) bury themselves into the [[domain|domains]] of such creatures.

## Oracular
An **oracular curse** is any curse whose affliction aligns them with a mystery of the world or of themselves, turning someone who has it into a colloquial '[[oracle|oracle]]'.
