Much like the real-world, **earth** describes the solid composition of the land of the world, replete with dirt, rock, sand, and silt. Within [[the Heavens]], earth is an [[elemental energy]], associated with possibility, creation, and bounty.

Magically, earth is a force of defined [[chaos]], forming one of the four fundamental axioms of nature, alongside [[fire]], [[water]], and [[air]]. The [[Plane#Realm|realm]] of earth for [[the Planet]], where its most potent power lies, is known to be [[the Below]].

Earth creates the fundamental elements of the [[Remnant|remnants]] which harbor life throughout the world, and so its power is made more important through its fundamental connection to [[gravity]]. Its fusion with [[fire]] forms the basis of [[metal]].
