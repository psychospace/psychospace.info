**Abjuration** is the [[magic]] study of **abjurers**, and is one of the eight [[Classical Schools]] of magic, interlinked with [[conjuration]]. Abjuration can be broadly categorized as a study of defense and its applications, and is sometimes characterized as the Classical School most focused on either [[antimagic]] or direct answers to magic, and it is quintessential as the foundation of protective magic in general.

Abjuration, by its vary nature, is comprised of powerful rites, rarely considered secretive. With regards to the [[Golden Voice]], it is believed that the rejection of an oncoming danger, the assertion of one's safety, must be performed with excessive force to assure victory. Within abjuration circles, abjuration is the effort of creating magical retorts to threats, physical and [[Psionics|psychic]] both. Particularly noteworthy [[ritual]] processes, such as [[exorcism]] and [[counterspell]], are considered parts of the study of abjuration.

Similar to its sister-study, abjuration is fascinated with the nitty-gritty of [[psychospace]], including reduction and instruction of the forces of [[chaos]]. As each force acts upon a [[Phoreus field|phoreus]], it creates opposed forces, and abjuration seeks to deeply understand and control these forces.
