At fulfilling the dying request of [[Maian Anseri]], [[Dinofang]] is forged by [[Stoneshaper Ethel]] from the claw of [[Sakuya and Ninigi|Sakuya]], imbuing it with psychospacial properties. The sword is given a [[Vorpal]] enchantment, but, worried that it might fall into the wrong hands, a control gem formed from the lesser blue scale nearby it binds it to the family and friends of the Dinos, embedded in its hilt.

It is forged initially for the hands of young [[Edmont Dino]], thus making its length perfect for that of a youth.
