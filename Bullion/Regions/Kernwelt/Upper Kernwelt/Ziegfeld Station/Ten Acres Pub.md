The local watering hole in [[Ziegfeld Station]] is the **Ten Acres**, proudly marked in plain-to-see white paint and bold letters. 

The Ten Acres is a skeezy bar attached to the plaza. Its regulars, a crochety female dwarf, a wood elf salaryman, and a halfling with purple hair, are usually out front playing cards and drinking. All three have one eye on the cadre of party members that are standing at the front of the bar, suspicious at new faces.

It's an ironically very small establishment sandwiched between two of the larger buildings in the plaza. The facade occupies only just a little more space than an alley in a larger village. Judging from aging wood stained by sand, it looks as though the larger, newer buildings ate up most of this building's original footprint and kept this place around as the bones of the past.

The pub itself is humid. Through tinted windows, most of the bar points toward the thin alley the bar's situated in, letting sunlight into the space and a visage of a dirt-colored brick wall. Though glass lamps remain hanging overhead and on tables for magelights, the interior is mostly darkened by the lack of them.

The bartender is a tall, older dark-skinned human man with hair tied back, *Inon*.  Inon's seen a number of bountymen come in assuming this is the office of the [[Daily Grind]], and while he's friends with his upstairs tenant, the old ex-priest isn't sure what they're exactly up to.
