A **dust tunnel**, sometimes called a **leywire**, is any infrastructure that is purpose-made to transfer [[Verlan|verlanic]] (dust) energy. They are named both for their purpose and for their appearance, as they seem to be tiny particulates of dust carried from cubic rock to cubic rock (mostly [[noemite]] chunks), causing a ringing sound throughout the countryside.

A network of dust tunnels — a **dust network** — allows for many types of machines and communications devices to be created with magic as a basis, without needing portable or localized forms of energy like [[mana]] crystals. 

# Forms
## Milieu
Also called a *locus station*, a **milieu** (plural: **milieux**) is the local [[Confluence|conflux]] of a dust tunnel network, usually either/both a receptor and a transmitter for the immediate vicinity.

These are usually marked by distinctive towers.

## Dust garden
The most well-known means of generating verlan is through a **dust garden** or **dust park**, a natural self-contained power-plant in the form of a garden or farm intended to cultivate a perpetual collection of unique orchids, trees, mosses, and other flora. 

The close proximity and [[senzai]] of these living things generates ambient verlan — ambient *intent* — that can be transduced into usable dust to enter the network. The contained nature of these enables their keepers to regularly meet the needs of a dust network. However, the intensive space and labor costs of such an endeavor do offset the benefits somewhat.

## Resonant tunnels
**Resonant tunnels** are the primary form of dust tunnels across distances, consisting of a suspended nodule-chain of noemite. These structures, suspended midair due to the reaction of noemite to [[Psinomenon|leylines]], propagate vibrations and the dust itself by touching one another, to "tunnel" and control the flow of information through verlan. 

Each nodule in a resonant tunnel can be individually controlled through [[#Milieu|milieu]] consensus actuators, allowing transmissions to control their destinations with immense precision.

## Psychograph
Wherever long wires go against cultural landscaping rules or would be too difficult or dangerous to span, optical semaphores known as **psychographs** may be subbed in to carry the network forward through mutual resonance. These are also referred to as **semiotic tunnels**. 

Psychographs propagate data through the network much slower and less privately than resonant hardwires, but is significantly cheaper (as the technology has existed about 20 years longer than resonant tunnels) and has spread more thoroughly. More psychographs exist throughout [[Bullion]], for example, than ley-wires, simply because technology hasn't spread that fast.
