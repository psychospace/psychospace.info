The **War of Chaos**, also called the **Shatter**, was a prehistoric [[âœ¼ Timeline|epoch]] which precipitated the close of the [[Old world|Old world]]. It was followed by the [[Unknown Era]].

# History
In a blind-spot in the utopian society of [[The Planet]], an ancient power arose, [[Chaos|what they called magic]], and smashed everything they knew to bits. Apocalypse quickly became a very real possibility. This chaos operated outside anybody's grasp, slowly devouring the world.

It was this will, to undo the progress of man, where a massive infinitely powerful being, [[The Maker]], arose.

The Maker worked with two Hands, one of destruction and chaos, and one of discovery and creation. The Hands of Maker worked to rebalance the universe, to restore the world, to recreate disorder so conflict, and different wills of mankind, could survive. This was because civilization must not stagnate itself, but it also inevitably can.

At the same time, it was hard for civilization to see the goodness of Maker. Here was a world on the verge of complete peace, and here, too, arose a being to break it.

So they rebelled against it, and in that rebellion only achieved self-destruction. Maker was infinitely powerful, and thus any attempts to stop it would be met with complete inevitability.

It is said that at this time, there were a split of people who fought for the Maker, and a second sect which fought against it, aware fully of inevitability and loath to embrace it. This conflict, later called The Shatter, embroiled in a changing reality, formed a sort of meta-consciousness that became known as [[The Unmaker]]. For perhaps obvious reasons, the two deities became something of a mix of each other: one being mistaken for the other.

At the end of this conflict, Maker had succeeded in its goal, as had Unmaker. For whatever reason, the conflict resolved in stalemates, and the two meta-consciousnesses met themselves in the middle, and became the same.

But as they looked around, all they saw was a broken world in an endless sky. Not destroyed or created, but irrevocably transformed into a pile of pieces.

With their goals achieved, however, the Maker vanished into thin air. Its fused remains, known as [[Anti]], would form the basis of the [[Divinity]] which would come to furnish the dying universe.
